INSTALLING SFFMS:

The sffms LaTeX class can be obtained from http://mcdemarco.net/sffms/, CTAN, or various repositories.

MikTex Tools is an easy way to install it. On Ubuntu, sffms is found in texlive-latex-extra.

INSTALLING LyX LAYOUTS:
Copy the layout files into your LyX layout directory. (/usr/share/lyx/layouts on Ubuntu). Open LyX and go to Tools > Reconfigure. Restart LyX.

ISSUES:
1) First paragraph must be indented. Currently, it isn't and using \usepackage{indentfirst} doesn't fix it for short story, but it does for novels. For short stories, add a part* prior to text and Insert > Formatting > Thinspace. This gives the correct result, but it's a hack!
2) The layout file will need to change after LyX 1.7/2.0 (the current dev version) is released. The sffms uses the preamble for title, author name, etc. In current versions of LyX this must be entered by hand. Version 1.7 and later should have support for doing this through the layout.
3) Scene breaks are added with Insert > TexCode \newscene . Need to change this!

Preamble Code (Copy and paste into Documents > Settings > LaTeX Preamble):

\author{H. G. Wells}
\surname{Wells}
\address{47 The High Street\\ Bromley, Kent}
\title{The Country of the Blind}
\runningtitle{Blind}
\wordcount{9600}

Edit the above to use your information.

See sffms docucmentation for other preamble options.

For novels with chapter titles, use chapter. For novels without chapter titles, use chapter*.
