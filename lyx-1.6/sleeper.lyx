\begin_layout Chapter
Insomnia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One afternoon, at low water, Mr.
 Isbister, a young artist lodging at Boscastle, walked from that place to
 the picturesque cove of Pentargen, desiring to examine the caves there.
 Halfway down the precipitous path to the Pentargen beach he came suddenly
 upon a man sitting in an attitude of profound distress beneath a projecting
 mass of rock.
 The hands of this man hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and
 staring before him, and his face was wet with tears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He glanced round at Isbister's footfall.
 Both men were disconcerted, Isbister the more so, and, to override the
 awkwardness of his involuntary pause, he remarked, with an air of mature
 conviction, that the weather was hot for the time of year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Very," answered the stranger shortly, hesitated a second, and added in
 a colourless tone, "I can't sleep."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isbister stopped abruptly.
 "No?" was all he said, but his bearing conveyed his helpful impulse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It may sound incredible," said the stranger, turning weary eyes to Isbister's
 face and emphasizing his words with a languid hand, "but I have had no
 sleep---no sleep at all for six nights."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Had advice?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes.
 Bad advice for the most part.
 Drugs.
 My nervous system

 .
 They are all very well for the run of people.
 It's hard to explain.
 I dare not take

 sufficiently powerful drugs."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That makes it difficult," said Isbister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed what to do.
 Clearly the man wanted to talk.
 An idea natural enough under the circumstances, prompted him to keep the
 conversation going.
 "I've never suffered from sleeplessness myself," he said in a tone of commonpla
ce gossip, "but in those cases I have known, people have usually found something
---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I dare make no experiments."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spoke wearily.
 He gave a gesture of rejection, and for a space both men were silent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Exercise?" suggested Isbister diffidently, with a glance from his interlocutor'
s face of wretchedness to the touring costume he wore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That is what I have tried.
 Unwisely perhaps.
 I have followed the coast, day after day---from New Quay.
 It has only added muscular fatigue to the mental.
 The cause of this unrest was overwork---trouble.
 There was something---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped as if from sheer fatigue.
 He rubbed his forehead with a lean hand.
 He resumed speech like one who talks to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering through a world in which I
 have no part.
 I am wifeless---childless---who is it speaks of the childless as the dead
 twigs on the tree of life? I am wifeless, I childless---I could find no
 duty to do.
 No desire even in my heart.
 One thing at last I set myself to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome the inertia of this dull
 body, I resorted to drugs.
 Great God, I've had enough of drugs! I don't know if 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its exasperating demand of time
 from the mind---time---life! Live! We only live in patches.
 We have to eat, and then comes the dull digestive complacencies---or irritation
s.
 We have to take the air or else our thoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run
 into gulfs and blind alleys.
 A thousand distractions arise from within and without, and then comes drowsines
s and sleep.
 Men seem to live for sleep.
 How little of a man's day is his own---even at the best! And then come
 those false friends, those Thug helpers, the alkaloids that stifle natural
 fatigue and kill rest---black coffee, cocaine---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I see," said Isbister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I did my work," said the sleepless man with a querulous intonation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And this is the price?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes." For a little while the two remained without speaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel---a hunger and thirst.
 For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool,
 swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere,
 spinning round swift and steady---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He paused.
 "Towards the gulf."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must sleep," said Isbister decisively, and with an air of a remedy
 discovered.
 "Certainly you must sleep."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"My mind is perfectly lucid.
 It was never clearer.
 But I know I am drawing towards the vortex.
 Presently---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of the light of the day, out
 of this sweet world of sanity---down---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But," expostulated Isbister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man threw out a hand towards him, and his eyes were wild, and his voice
 suddenly high.
 "I shall kill myself.
 If in no other way---at the foot of yonder dark precipice there, where
 the waves are green, and the white surge lifts and falls, and that little
 thread of water trembles down.
 There at any rate is 
\begin_inset ERT

 sleep."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That's unreasonable," said Isbister, startled at the man's hysterical gust
 of emotion.
 "Drugs are better than that."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There at any rate is sleep," repeated the stranger, not heeding him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if some complex Providence
 had indeed brought them together that afternoon.
 "It's not a cert, you know," he remarked.
 " There's a cliff like that at Lulworth Cove---as high, anyhow---and a
 little girl fell from top to bottom.
 And lives to-day---sound and well."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But those rocks there? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"One might lie on them rather dismally through a cold night, broken bones
 grating as one shivered, chill water splashing over you.
 Eh? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their eyes met.
 "Sorry to upset your ideals," said Isbister with a sense of devil-may-careish
 brilliance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But a suicide over that cliff (or any cliff for the matter of that), really,
 as an artist---" He laughed.
 "It's so damned amateurish."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But the other thing," said the sleepless man irritably, "the other thing.
 No man can keep sane if night after night---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Have you been walking along this coast alone? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Silly sort of thing to do.
 If you'll excuse my saying so.
 Alone! As you say; body fag is no cure for brain fag.
 Who told you to? No wonder; walking! And the sun on your head, heat, fag,
 solitude, all the day long, and then, I suppose, you go to bed and try
 very hard---eh?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Look at these rocks!" cried the seated man with a sudden force of gesture.
 "Look at that sea that has shone and quivered there for ever! See the white
 spume rush into darkness under that great cliff.
 And this blue vault, with the blinding sun pouring from the dome of it.
 It is your world.
 You accept it, you rejoice in it.
 It warms and supports and delights you.
 And for me---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned his head and showed a ghastly face, bloodshot pallid eyes and
 bloodless lips.
 He spoke almost in a whisper.
 "It is the garment of my misery.
 The whole world
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
dots
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the garment of my misery."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about them and
 back to that face of despair For a moment he was silent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection.
 "You get a night's sleep," he said, "and you won't see much misery out
 here.
 Take my word for it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter.
 Only half an hour ago he had been feeling horribly bored.
 Here was employment the bare thought of which was righteous self-applause.
 He took possession forthwith.
 It seemed to him that the first need of this exhausted being was companionship
 He flung himself down on the steeply sloping turf beside the motionless
 seated figure, and deployed forthwith into a skirmishing line of gossip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy; he stared dismally seaward,
 and spoke only in answer to Isbister's direct questions---and not to all
 of those But he made no sign of objection to this benevolent intrusion
 upon his despair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a helpless way he seemed even grateful, and when presently Isbister,
 feeling that his unsupported talk was losing vigour, suggested that they
 should reascend the steep and return towards Boscastle, alleging the view
 into Blackapit, he submitted quietly.
 Halfway up he began talking to himself, and abruptly turned a ghastly face
 on his helper.
 "What can be happening?" he asked with a gaunt illustrative hand.
 "What can be happening? Spin, spin, spin, spin.
 It goes round and round, round and round for evermore."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood with his hand circling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It's all right, old chap," said Isbister with the air of an old friend.
 "Don't worry yourself.
 Trust to me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man dropped his hand and turned again.
 They went over the brow in single file and to the headland beyond Penally,
 with the sleepless man gesticulating ever and again, and speaking fragmentary
 things concerning his whirling brain.
 At the headland they stood for a space by the seat that looks into the
 dark mysteries of Blackapit, and then he sat down.
 Isbister had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened sufficiently
 for them to walk abreast.
 He was enlarging upon the complex difficulty of making Boscastle Harbour
 in bad weather, when suddenly and quite irrelevantly his companion interrupted
 him again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"My head is not like what it was," he said, gesticulating for want of expressive
 phrases.
 "It's not like what it was.
 There is a sort of oppression, a weight.
 No---not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like a shadow, a deep shadow
 falling suddenly and swiftly across something busy.
 Spin, spin into the darkness The tumult of thought, the confusion, the
 eddy and eddy.
 I can't express it.
 I can hardly keep my mind on it---steadily enough to tell you."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped feebly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" Don't trouble, old chap," said Isbister.
 "I think I can understand.
 At any rate, it don't matter very much just at present about telling me,
 you know."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them.
 Isbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then he had
 a fresh idea.
 "Come down to my room," he said, "and try a pipe.
 I can show you some sketches of this Blackapit.
 If you'd care? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other rose obediently and followed him down the steep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his movements
 were slow and hesitating.
 "Come in with me," said Isbister, "and try some cigarettes and the blessed
 gift of alcohol.
 If you take alcohol?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stranger hesitated at the garden gate.
 He seemed no longer clearly aware of his actions.
 "I don't drink," he said slowly, coming up the garden path, and after a
 moment's interval repeated absently, "No---I don't drink.
 It goes round.
 Spin, it goes---spin---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing of one
 who sees nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy chair, seemed almost to
 fall into it.
 He leant forward with his brows on his hands and became motionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presently he made a faint sound in his throat.
 Isbister moved about the room with the nervousness of an inexperienced
 host, making little remarks that scarcely required answering.
 He crossed the room to his portfolio, placed it on the table and noticed
 the mantel clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I don't know if you'd care to have supper with me," he said with an unlighted
 cigarette in his hand---his mind troubled with a design of the furtive
 administration of chloral.
 "Only cold mutton, you know, but passing sweet.
 Welsh.
 And a tart, I believe." He repeated this after momentary silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seated man made no answer.
 Isbister stopped, match in hand, regarding him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stillness lengthened.
 The match went out, the cigarette was put down unlit.
 The man was certainly very still.
 Isbister took up the portfolio, opened it, put it down, hesitated, seemed
 about to speak.
 "Perhaps," he whispered doubtfully.
 Presently he glanced at the door and back to the figure.
 Then he stole on tiptoe out of the room, glancing at his companion after
 each elaborate pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He closed the door noiselessly.
 The house door was standing open, and he went out beyond the porch, and
 stood where the monkshood rose at the corner of the garden bed.
 From this point he could see the stranger through the open window, still
 and dim, sitting head on hand.
 He had not moved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the artist
 curiously.
 A boatman exchanged civilities with him.
 He felt that possibly his circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar
 and unaccountable.
 Smoking, perhaps, might seem more natural.
 He drew pipe and pouch from his pocket, filled the pipe slowly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I wonder," 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 he said, with a scarcely perceptible loss of complacency.
 " At any rate we must give him a chance." He struck a match in the virile
 way, and proceeded to light his pipe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presently he heard his landlady behind him, coming with his lamp lit from
 the kitchen.
 He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped her at the door of
 his sitting-room.
 He had some difficulty in explaining the situation in whispers, for she
 did not know he had a visitor.
 She retreated again with the lamp, still a little mystified to judge from
 her manner, and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the porch, flushed
 and less at his ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Long after he had smoked out his pipe, and when the bats were abroad, his
 curiosity dominated his complex hesitations, and he stole back into his
 darkling sitting-room.
 He paused in the doorway.
 The stranger was still in the same attitude, dark against the window.
 Save for the singing of some sailors aboard one of the little slate-carrying
 ships in the harbour, the evening was very still.
 Outside, the spikes of monkshood and delphinium stood erect and motionless
 against the shadow of the hillside.
 Something flashed into Isbister's mind; he started, and leaning over the
 table, listened.
 An unpleasant suspicion grew stronger; became conviction.
 Astonishment seized him and became---dread!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No sound of breathing came from the seated figure!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He crept slowly and noiselessly round the table, pausing twice to listen.
 At last he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair.
 He bent down until the two heads were ear to ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he bent still lower to look up at his visitor's face.
 He started violently and uttered an exclamation.
 The eyes were void spaces of white.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled under
 the lids.
 He was suddenly afraid.
 Overcome by the strangeness of the man's condition, he took him by the
 shoulder and shook him.
 "Are you asleep?" he said, with his voice jumping into alto, and again,
 "Are you asleep?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead.
 He suddenly became active and noisy, strode across the room, blundering
 against the table as he did so, and rang the bell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Please bring a light at once," he said in the passage.
 "There is something wrong with my friend."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he returned to the motionless seated figure, grasped the shoulder,
 shook it, and shouted.
 The room was flooded with yellow glare as his astonished landlady entered
 with the light.
 His face was white as he turned blinking towards her.
 "I must fetch a doctor at once," he said.
 "It is either death or a fit.
 Is there a doctor in the village? Where is a doctor to be found? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Trance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen, lasted for
 an unprecedented length of time, and then he passed slowly to the flaccid
 state, to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose.
 Then it was his eyes could be closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was removed from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the surgery,
 after some weeks, to London.
 But he still resisted every attempt at reanimation.
 After a time, for reasons that will appear later, these attempts were discontin
ued.
 For a great space he lay in that strange condition, inert and still neither
 dead nor living but, as it were, suspended, hanging midway between nothingness
 and existence.
 His was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation, a dreamless
 inanition, a vast space of peace.
 The tumult of his mind had swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence.
 Where was the man? Where is any man when insensibility takes hold of him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It seems only yesterday," said Isbister.
 "I remember it all as though it happened yesterday---clearer perhaps, than
 if it had happened yesterday."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the Isbister of the last chapter, but he was no longer a young man.
 The hair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the fashionable
 length, was iron grey and clipped close, and the face that had been pink
 and white was buff and ruddy.
 He had a pointed beard shot with grey.
 He talked to an elderly man who wore a summer suit of drill (the summer
 of that year was unusually hot).
 This was Warming, a London solicitor and next of kin to Graham, the man
 who had fallen into the trance.
 And the two men stood side by side in a room in a house in London regarding
 his recumbent figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a yellow figure Iying lax upon a water-bed and clad in a flowing
 shirt, a figure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard, lean limbs and
 lank nails, and about it was a case of thin glass.
 This glass seemed to mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about
 him, he was a thing apart, a strange, isolated abnormality.
 The two men stood close to the glass, peering in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The thing gave me a shock," said Isbister "I feel a queer sort of surprise
 even now when I think of his white eyes.
 They were white, you know, rolled up.
 Coming here again brings it all back to me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Have you never seen him since that time? " asked Warming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Often wanted to come," said Isbister; "but business nowadays is too serious
 a thing for much holiday keeping.
 I've been in America most of the time."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If I remember rightly," said Warming, "you were an artist?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Was.
 And then I became a married man.
 I saw it was all up with black and white, very soon---at least for a mediocre
 man, and I jumped on to process.
 Those posters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Good posters," admitted the solicitor, "though I | was sorry to see them
 there." I
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary," exclaimed Isbister with satisfaction.
 " The world changes.
 When he fell asleep, twenty years ago, I was down at Boscastle with a box
 of water-colours and a noble, old-fashioned ambition.
 I didn't expect that some day my pigments would glorify the whole blessed
 coast of England, from Land's End round again to the Lizard.
 Luck comes to a man very often when he's not looking."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck.
 " I just missed seeing you, if I recollect aright."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford railway station.
 It was close on the Jubilee, Victoria's Jubilee, because I remember the
 seats and flags in Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The Diamond Jubilee, it was," said Warming; "the second one."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ah, yes ! At the proper Jubilee---the Fifty Year affair---I was down at
 Wookey---a boy.
 I missed all that

\end_inset

 .
 What a fuss we had with him! My landlady wouldn't take him in, wouldn't
 let him stay---he looked so queer when he was rigid.
 We had to carry him in a chair up to the hotel.
 And the Boscastle doctor---it wasn't the present chap, but the G.P.
 before him---was at him until nearly two, with, me and the landlord holding
 lights and so forth."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It was a cataleptic rigour at first, wasn't it?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Stiff!---wherever you bent him he stuck.
 You might have stood him on his head and he'd have stopped.
 I never saw such stiffness.
 Of course this"---he indicated the prostrate figure by a movement of his
 head---" is quite different.
 And, of course, the little doctor---what was his name?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Smithers? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Smithers it was---was quite wrong in trying to fetch him round too soon,
 according to all accounts.
 The things he did.
 Even now it makes me feel all---ugh! Mustard, snuff, pricking.
 And one of those beastly little things, not dynamos---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Induction coils."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes.
 You could see his muscles throb and jump, and he twisted about.
 There was just two flaring yellow candles, and all the shadows were shivering,
 and the little doctor nervous and putting on side, and him---stark and
 squirming in the most unnatural ways.
 Well, it made me dream."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It's a strange state," said Warming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" It's a sort of complete absence," said Isbister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Here's the body, empty.
 Not dead a bit, and yet not alive.
 It's like a seat vacant and marked 'engaged.' No feeling, no digestion,
 no beating of the heart---not a flutter.
 
\emph on
That
\emph default
 doesn't make me feel as if there was a man present.
 In a sense it's more dead than death, for these doctors tell me that even
 the hair has stopped growing.
 Now with the proper dead, the hair will go on growing---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I know," said Warming, with a flash of pain in his expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They peered through the glass again.
 Graham was indeed in a strange state, in the flaccid phase of a trance,
 but a trance unprecedented in medical history.
 Trances had lasted for as much as a year before---but at the end of that
 time it had ever been waking or a death; sometimes first one and then the
 other.
 Isbister noted the marks the physicians had made in injecting nourishment,
 for that device had been resorted to to postpone collapse; he pointed them
 out to Warming, who had been trying not to see them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And while he has been Iying here," said Isbister, with the zest of a life
 freely spent, " I have changed my plans in life; married, raised a family,
 my eldest lad---I hadn't begun to think of sons then---is an American citizen,
 and looking forward to leaving Harvard.
 There's a touch of grey in my hair.
 And this man, not a day older nor wiser (practically) than I was in my
 downy days.
 It's curious to think of."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warming turned.
 "And I have grown old too.
 I played cricket with him when I was still only a lad.
 And he looks a young man still.
 Yellow perhaps.
 But that is a young man nevertheless."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And there's been the War," said Isbister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"From beginning to end."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And these Martians."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I've understood," said Isbister after a pause, "that he had some moderate
 property of his own?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That is so," said Warming.
 He coughed primly.
 "As it happens---have charge of it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" Ah!" Isbister thought, hesitated and spoke: "No doubt---his keep here
 is not expensive---no doubt it will have improved---accumulated?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It has.
 He will wake up very much better off---if he wakes---than when he slept."

"As a business man," said Isbister, "that thought has naturally been in
 my mind.
 I have, indeed, sometimes thought that, speaking commercially, of course,
 this sleep may be a very good thing for him.
 That he knows what he is about, so to speak, in being insensible so long.
 If he had lived straight on---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I doubt if he would have premeditated as much," said Warming.
 "He was not a far-sighted man.
 In fact---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We differed on that point.
 I stood to him some- what in the relation of a guardian.
 You have probably seen enough of affairs to recognise that occasionally
 a certain friction---.
 But even if that was the case, there is a doubt whether he will ever wake.
 This sleep exhausts slowly, but it exhausts.
 Apparently he is sliding slowly, very slowly and tediously, down a long
 slope, if you can understand me? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It will be a pity to lose his surprise.
 There's been a lot of change these twenty years.
 It's Rip Van Winkle come real."

\begin_layout Standard
"It's Bellamy," said Warming.
 " There has been a lot of change certainly.
 And, among other changes, I have changed.
 I am an old man."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Isbister hesitated, and then feigned a belated surprise.
 "I shouldn't have thought it."

\begin_layout Standard
"I was forty-three when his bankers---you remember you wired to his bankers---se

\begin_layout Standard
"I got their address from the cheque book in his pocket," said Isbister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well, the addition is not difficult," said Warming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was another pause, and then Isbister gave way to an unavoidable curiosity.
 "He may go on for years yet," he said, and had a moment of hesitation.
 "We have to consider that.
 His affairs, you know, may fall some day into the hands of---someone else,
 you know."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That, if you will believe me, Mr.
 Isbister, is one of the problems most constantly before my mind.
 We happen to be---as a matter of fact, there are no very trustworthy connection

 It is a grotesque and unprecedented position."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is," said Isbister.
 "As a matter of fact, it's a case for a public trustee, if only we had
 such a functionary."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It seems to me it's a case for some public body, some practically undying
 guardian.
 If he really is going on living---as the doctors, some of them, think.
 As a matter of fact, I have gone to one or two public men about it.
 But, so far, nothing has been done."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It wouldn't be a bad idea to hand him over to some public body---the British
 Museum Trustees, or the Royal College of Physicians.
 Sounds a bit odd, of course, but the whole situation is odd."

Pause.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If he wakes," echoed Isbister.
 "Do you notice the pinched-ill look of his nose, and the way in which his
 eyelids sink?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warming looked and thought for a space.
 "I doubt if he will wake," he said at last.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I never properly understood," said Isbister, "what it was brought this
 on.
 He told me something about overstudy.
 I've often been curious."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"He was a man of considerable gifts, but spasmodic, emotional.
 He had grave domestic troubles, divorced his wife, in fact, and it was
 as a relief from that, I think, that he took up politics of the rabid sort.
 He was a fanatical Radical---a Socialist---or typical Liberal, as they
 used to call themselves,-of the advanced school.
 Energetic---flighty---undisciplined.
 Overwork upon a controversy did this for him.
 I remember the pamphlet he wrote---a curious production.
 Wild, whirling stuff.
 There were one or two prophecies.
 Some of them are already exploded, some of them are established facts.
 But for the most part to read such a thesis is to realise how full the
 world is of unanticipated things.
 He will have much to learn, much to unlearn, when he wakes.
 If ever a waking comes."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'd give anything to be there," said Isbister, "just to hear what he would
 say to it all."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So would I," said Warming.
 "Aye! so would I," with an old man's sudden turn to self pity.
 "But I shall never see him wake."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure.
 "He will never wake," he said at last.
 He sighed "He will never wake again."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Awakening
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Warming was wrong in that.
 An awakening came.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What a wonderfully complex thing! this simple seeming unity---the self!
 Who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the
 flux and confluence of its countless factors intenveaving, rebuilding,
 the dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of the unconsciou
s to the subconscious, the sub-conscious to dawning consciousness, until
 at last we recognise ourselves again.
 And as it happens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with
 Graham at the end of his vast slumber.
 A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a cloudy dreariness, and he found
 himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent, faint, but alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs, to
 occupy epochs.
 Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time, left vague perplexing
 memories, strange creatures, strange scenery, as if from another planet.
 There was a distinct impression, too, of a momentous conversation, of a
 name---he could not tell what name---that was subsequently to recur, of
 some queer long-forgotten sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of
 vast hopeless effort, the effort of a man near drowning in darkness.
 Then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham became aware his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood.
 He moved his head slightly, following the contour of this shape.
 It went up beyond the top of his eyes.
 He tried to think where he might be.
 Did it matter, seeing he was so wretched? The colour of his thoughts was
 a dark depression.
 He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn.
 He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness.
 He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley---but
 he could not recall that white edge.
 He must have slept.
 He remembered now that he had wanted to sleep.
 He recalled the cliff and waterfall again, and then recollected something
 about talking to a passer-by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How long had he slept? What was that sound of pattering feet? And that rise
 and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a languid
 hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place
 it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass.
 This was so unexpected that it startled him extremely.
 Quite suddenly he rolled over, stared for a moment, and struggled into
 a sitting position.
 The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak---and
 amazed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He rubbed his eyes.
 The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his mind was quite clear---evi
dently his sleep had benefited him.
 He was not in a bed at all as he understood the word, but Iying naked on
 a very soft and yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass.
 The mattress was partly transparent, a fact he observed with a strange
 sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly.
 About his arm---and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangIy dry
 and yellow---was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly
 that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below.
 And this strange bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as
 it seemed to him), a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested
 his attention.
 In the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made
 apparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances, though a maximum
 and minimum thermometer was recognisable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance which surrounded
 him on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a vast
 apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple white
 archway facing him.
 Close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture, a table covered
 with a silvery cloth, silvery like the side of a fish, a couple of graceful
 chairs, and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them,
 a bottle and two glasses.
 He realised that he was intensely hungry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could see no human being, and after a period of hesitation scrambled
 off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor
 of his little apartment.
 He had miscalculated his strength, however, and staggered and put his hand
 against the glasslike pane before him to steady himself.
 For a moment it resisted his hand, bending outward like a distended bladder,
 then it broke with a slight report and vanished---a pricked bubble.
 He reeled out into the general space of the hall, greatly astonished.
 He caught at the table to save himself, knocking one of the glasses to
 the floor---it rang but did not break---and sat down in one of the armchairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle
 and drank---a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a pleasing
 faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus.
 He put down the vessel and looked about him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish
 transparency that had intervened was removed.
 The archway he saw led to a flight of steps, going downward without the
 intermediation of a door, to a spacious transverse passage.
 This passage ran between polished pillars of some white-veined substance
 of deep ultramarine, and along it came the sound of human movements and
 voices and a deep undeviating droning note.
 He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly, forgetting the viands in his
 attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him
 for covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside
 him.
 This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mind was still a surging perplexity.
 Clearly he had slept.
 and had been removed in his sleep.
 But here? And who were those people, the distant crowd beyond the deep
 blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured out and partially drank another glass
 of the colourless fluid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What was this place?---this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering
 like a thing alive? He looked about him at the clean and beautiful form
 of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the roof was broken
 in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and, as he looked, a steady,
 sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed, and came again and passed.
 "Beat, beat," that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued
 tumult that filled the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat.
 Then he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his
 way towards the archway.
 He staggered down the steps, tripped on the corner of the black cloak he
 had wrapped about himself, and saved himself by catching at one of the
 blue pillars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple, and ended remotely
 in a railed space like a balcony, brightly lit and projecting into a space
 of haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building.
 Beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms.
 The tumult of voices rose now loud and clear, and on the balcony and with
 their backs to him, gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation,
 were three figures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright
 soft colourings.
 The noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony, and
 once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and once some brightly coloured
 object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps, flashed
 athwart the space and fell.
 The shouts sounded like English, there was a reiteration of "Wake!" He
 heard some indistinct shrill cry, and abruptly the three men began laughing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed one---a red-haired man in a short purple robe.
 "When the Sleeper wakes---
\emph on
When!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage.
 His face changed, the whole man changed, became rigid.
 The other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless.
 Their faces assumed an expression of consternation, an expression that
 deepened into awe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar collapsed
 limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Sound of Tumult
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham's last impression before he fainted was of a clamorous ringing of
 bells.
 He learnt afterwards that he was insensible, hanging between life and death,
 for the better part of an hour.
 When he recovered his senses, he was back on his translucent couch, and
 there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat.
 The dark apparatus, he perceived, had been removed from his arm, which
 was bandaged.
 The white framework was still about him, but the greenish transparent substance
 that had filled it was altogether gone.
 A man in a deep violet robe, one of those who had been on the balcony,
 was looking keenly into his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds, that suggested
 to his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting together.
 Something seemed to fall across this tumult, a door suddenly closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham moved his head.
 "What does this all mean?" he said slowly.
 "Where am I?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw the red-haired man who had been first to discover him.
 A voice seemed to be asking what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking English with a slightly
 foreign accent, or so at least it seemed to the Sleeper's ears, "You are
 quite safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You were brought hither from where you fell asleep.
 It is quite safe.
 You have been here some time---sleeping.
 In a trance."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said something further that Graham could not hear, and a little phial
 was handed across to him.
 Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist played over his forehead for
 a moment, and his sense of refreshment increased.
 He closed his eyes in satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" Better?" asked the man in violet, as Graham's eyes reopened.
 He was a pleasant-faced man of thirty, perhaps, with a pointed flaxen beard,
 and a clasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes," said Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You have been asleep some time.
 In a cataleptic trance.
 You have heard? Catalepsy? It may seem strange to you at first, but I can
 assure you everything is well."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham did not answer, but these words served their reassuring purpose.
 His eyes went from face to face of the three people about him.
 They were regarding him strangely.
 He knew he ought to be somewhere in Cornwall, but he could not square these
 things with that impression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at Boscastle
 recurred, a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected.
 He cleared his throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Have you wired my cousin?" he asked.
 "E.
 Warming, 27, Chancery Lane? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were all assiduous to hear.
 But he had to repeat it.
 "What an odd 
\emph on

\emph default
 in his accent!" whispered the red-haired man.
 "Wire, sir?" said the young man with the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"He means send an electric telegram," volunteered the third, a pleasant-faced
 youth of nineteen or twenty.
 The flaxen-bearded man gave a cry of comprehension.
 "How stupid of me! You may be sure everything shall be done, sir," he said
 to Graham.
 "I am afraid it would be difficult to---wire to your cousin.
 He is not in London now.
 But don't trouble about arrangements yet; you have been asleep a very long
 time and the important thing is to get over that, sir." (Graham concluded
 the word was sir, but this man pronounced it "Sire.")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Oh!" said Graham, and became quiet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar dress
 knew what they were about.
 Yet they were odd and the room was odd.
 It seemed he was in some newly established place.
 He had a sudden flash of suspicion.
 Surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition! If it was he would give
 Warming a piece of his mind.
 But it scarcely had that character.
 And in a place of public exhibition he would not have discovered himself
 naked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened.
 There was no perceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge.
 Abruptly he knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as if
 by some processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces
 that peered into his.
 He looked at them strangely, full of intense emotion.
 It seemed they read his eyes.
 He framed his lips to speak and could not.
 A queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the
 moment of his discovery.
 He looked at his bare feet, regarding then silently.
 His impulse to speak passed.
 He was trembling exceedingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty taste,
 and the assurance of returning strength grew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That---that makes me feel better," he said hoarsely, and there were murmurs
 of respectful approval.
 He knew now quite clearly.
 He made to speak again, and again he could not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pressed his throat and tried a third time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How long? " he asked in a level voice.
 "How long have I been asleep? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Some considerable time," said the flaxen-bearded man, glancing quickly
 at the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How long? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"A very long time."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes---yes," said Graham, suddenly testy.
 "But I want---Is it---it is---some years? Many years? There was something---I
 forget what.
 I feel---confused.
 But you---" He sobbed.
 "You need not fence with me.
 How long---?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped, breathing irregularly.
 He squeezed his eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They spoke in undertones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Five or six?" he asked faintly.
 "More?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Very much more than that."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Morel "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"More."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles
 of his face.
 He looked his question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Many years," said the man with the red beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham struggled into a sitting position.
 He wiped a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand.
 "Many years!" he repeated.
 He shut his eyes tight, opened them, and sat looking about him, from one
 unfamiliar thing to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How many years?" he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must be prepared to be surprised."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"More than a gross of years."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was irritated at the strange word." More than a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two of them spoke together.
 Some quick remarks that were made about "decimal" he did not catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How long did you say? " asked Graham.
 "How long? Don't look like that.
 Tell me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: "More than
 a couple of centuries."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
"Whats?"
\emph default
 he cried, turning on the youth who he thought had spoken.
 "Who says---? What was that? A couple of centuries!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes," said the man with the red beard.
 "Two hundred years."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham repeated the words.
 He had been prepared to hear of a vast repose, and yet these concrete centuries
 defeated him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Two hundred years," he said again, with the figure of a great gulf opening
 very slowly in his mind; and then, "Oh, but---!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You---did you say---? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Two hundred years.
 Two centuries of years," said the man with the red beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a pause.
 Graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had heard was indeed
 true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But it can't be," he said querulously.
 "I am dreaming.
 Trances.
 Trances don't last.
 That is not right---this is a joke you have played upon me! Tell me---some
 days ago, perhaps, I was walking along the coast of Cornwall---? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His voice failed him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the flaxen beard hesitated.
 "I'm not very strong in history, sir," he said weakly, and glanced at the
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That was it, sir," said the youngster.
 "Boscastle, in the old Duchy of Cornwall---it's in the southwest country
 beyond the dairy meadows.
 There is a house there still.
 I have been there."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Boscastle!" Graham turned his eyes to the youngster.
 "That was it---Boscastle.
 Little Boscastle.
 I fell asleep---somewhere there.
 I don't exactly remember.
 I don't exactly remember."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pressed his brows and whispered," More than two hundred years!" I
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was cold
 within him.
 "But if it is two hundred years, every soul I know, every human being that
 ever I saw or spoke to before I went to sleep, must be dead."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did not answer him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, of Church and State.
 High and low, rich and poor, one with another---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is there England still?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That's a comfort! Is there London?" E "This

 London, eh? And you are my assistant---custodian; assistant-custodian.
 And these---? Eh? Assistant-custodians to?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat with a gaunt stare on his face.
 "But why am I here? No! Don't talk.
 Be quiet.
 Let me---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another little
 glass of pinkish fluid held towards him.
 He took the dose.
 It was almost immediately sustaining.
 Directly he had taken it he began to weep naturally and refreshingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears,
 a little foolishly.
 "But---two---hun---dred---years ! " he said.
 He grimaced hysterically and covered up his face again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a space he grew calm.
 He sat up, his hands hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same
 attitude in which Isbister had found him on the cliff at Pentargen.
 His attention was attracted by a thick domineering voice, the footsteps
 of an advancing personage.
 "What are you doing? Why was I not warned? Surely you could tell? Someone
 will suffer for this.
 The man must be kept quiet.
 Are the doorways closed? All the doorways? He must be kept perfectly quiet.
 He must not be told.
 Has he been told anything?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham looking
 over his shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and thickset beardless
 man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin.
 Very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his
 nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression.
 He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard returned to the man
 with the flaxen beard.
 "These others," he said in a voice of extreme irritation.
 "You had better go."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Go? " said the red-bearded man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Certainly---go now.
 But see the doorways are closed as you go."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance at Graham,
 and instead of going through the archway as he expected, walked straight
 to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway.
 And then came a strange thing; a long strip of this apparently solid wall
 rolled up with a snap, hung over the two retreating men and fell again,
 and immediately Graham was alone with the new comer and the purple-robed
 man with the flaxen beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham, but
 proceeded to interrogate the other---obviously his subordinate---upon the
 treatment of their charge.
 He spoke clearly, but in phrases only partially intelligible to Graham.
 The awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but of consternation
 and annoyance to him.
 He was evidently profoundly excited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must not confuse his mind by telling him things," he repeated again
 and again.
 "You must not confuse his mind."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper
 with an ambiguous expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Feel queer? " he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Very."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose so, now."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"They---" said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxen-bearded man
 met his eye and went away.
 "You will very speedily have clothes," said the thickset man.

"Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred---?" asked Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and three, as a matter
 of fact."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed
 mouth.
 He sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, "Is there a mill
 or dynamo near here?" He did not wait for an answer.
 "Things have changed tremendously, I suppose?" he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is that shouting? " he asked abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nothing," said the thickset man impatiently.
 "It's people.
 You'll understand better later---perhaps.
 As you say, things have changed." He spoke shortly, his brows were knit,
 and he glanced about him like a man trying to decide in an emergency.
 "We must get you clothes and so forth, at any rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Better wait here until some can come.
 No one will come near you.
 You want shaving."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham rubbed his chin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly, listened
 for a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried off through
 the archway towards the balcony.
 The tumult of shouting grew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened
 also.
 He cursed suddenly under his breath, and turned his eyes upon Graham with
 an unfriendly expression.
 It was a surge of many voices, rising and falling, shouting and screaming,
 and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries, and then a snapping like
 the crackling of dry sticks.
 Graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven
 tumult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula.
 For a time he doubted his ears.
 But surely these were the words: " how us the Sleeper! Show us the Sleeper!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Wild! " he cried, "How do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was perhaps an answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I can't come," said the thickset man; "I have 
\emph on
him
\emph default
 to see to.
 But shout from the balcony."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was an inaudible reply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Say he is not awake.
 Anything! I leave it to you."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He came hurrying back to Graham.
 "You must have clothes at once," he said.
 "You cannot stop here---and it will be impossible to---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him.
 In a moment he was back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I can't tell you what is happening.
 It is too complex to explain.
 In a moment you shall have your clothes made.
 Yes---in a moment.
 And then I can take you away from here.
 You will find out our troubles soon enough."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But those voices.
 They were shouting---?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Something about the Sleeper---that's you.
 They have some twisted idea.
 I don't know what it is.
 I know nothing."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote noises,
 and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner
 of the room.
 He listened for a moment, regarding a ball of crystal, nodded, and said
 a few indistinct words; then he walked to the wall through which the two
 men had vanished.
 It rolled up again like a curtain, and he stood waiting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the restoratives
 had given him.
 He thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the other.
 His head no longer swam.
 He could scarcely credit his rapid recovery.
 He sat feeling his limbs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did
 so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man, and
 a lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a tightly-fitting
 costume of dark green, appeared therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This is the tailor," said the thickset man with an introductory gesture."
 It will never do for you to wear that black.
 I cannot understand how it got here.
 But I shall.
 I shall.
 You will be as rapid as possible? " he said to the tailor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated himself by Graham on the
 bed.
 His manner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity.
 "You will find the fashions altered, Sire," he said.
 He glanced from under his brows at the thickset man.
 ,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant
 fabrics poured out over his knees.
 "You lived, Sire, in a period essentially cylindrical---the Victorian.
 With a tendency to the hemisphere in hats.
 Circular curves always.
 Now---" He flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of a
 keyless watch, whirled the knob, and behold---a little figure in white
 appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial, walking and turning.
 The tailor caught up a pattern of bluish white satin.
 "That is my conception of your immediate treatment," he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We have very little time," he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Trust me," said the tailor.
 "My machine follows.
 What do you think of this? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is that?" asked the man from the nineteenth century.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"In your days they showed you a fashion-plate," said the tailor," but this
 is our modern development See here." The little figure repeated its evolutions,
 but in a different costume.
 "Or this," and with a click another small figure in a more voluminous type
 of robe marched on to the dial.
 The tailor was very quick in his movements, and glanced twice towards the
 lift as he did these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with features of the Chinese
 type, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with a complicated
 machine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the room.
 Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, Graham was invited to
 stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some instructions
 to the crop-haired lad, who answered in guttural tones and with words Graham
 did not recognise.
 The boy then went to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the corner,
 and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in little
 discs, pulling them out until the discs were flat against the body of Graham,
 one at each shoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so forth,
 so that at last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon his body and
 limbs.
 At the same time, some other person entered the room by the lift, behind
 Graham.
 The tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint-sounding rhythmic
 movement of parts in the machine, and in another moment he was knocking
 up the levers and Graham was released.
 The tailor replaced his cloak of black, and the man with the flaxen beard
 proffered him a little glass of some refreshing fluid.
 Graham saw over the rim of the glass a pale-faced young man regarding him
 with a singular fixity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned and
 went through the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of a
 distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences.
 The cropheaded lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the
 two began fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll
 of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine.
 Then they ran the entire thing on its easy, noiseless bearings across the
 room to a remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully
 from the wall.
 They made some connexion and the machine became energetic and swift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is that doing?" asked Graham, pointing with the empty glass to the
 busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer.
 " Is that---some sort of force---laid on? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes," said the man with the flaxen beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Who is that?" He indicated the archway behind him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered in an
 undertone, "He is Howard, your chief guardian.
 You see, Sire,---it's a little difficult to explain.
 The Council appoints a guardian and assistants.
 This hall has under certain restrictions been public.
 In order that people might satisfy themselves.
 We have barred the doorways for the first time.
 But I think---if you don't mind, I will leave him to explain."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Odd" said Graham.
 " Guardian? Council?" Then turning his back on the new comer, he asked
 in an undertone, "Why is this man glaring at me? Is he a mesmerist? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Capillotomist!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes---one of the chief.
 His yearly fee is sixdoz lions."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It sounded sheer nonsense.
 Graham snatched at the last phrase with an unsteady mind.
 "Sixdoz lions?" he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Didn't you have lions? I suppose not.
 You had the old pounds? They are our monetary units."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But what was that you said---sixdoz? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes.
 Six dozen, Sire.
 Of course things, even these little things, have altered.
 You lived in the days of the decimal system, the Arab system---tens, and
 little hundreds and thousands.
 We have eleven numerals now.
 We have single figures for both ten and eleven, two figures for a dozen,
 and a dozen dozen makes a gross, a great hundred, you know, a dozen gross
 a dozand, and a dozand dozand a myriad.
 Very simple?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose so," said Graham.
 "But about this cap---what was it? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Here are your clothes!" he said.
 Graham turned round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow smiling,
 and holding some palpably new garments over his arm.
 The crop-headed boy, by means of one finger, was impelling the complicated
 machine towards the lift by which he had arrived.
 Graham stared at the completed suit.
 "You don't mean to say---!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Just made," said the tailor.
 He dropped the garments at the feet of Graham, walked to the bed on which
 Graham had so recently been Iying, flung out the translucent mattress,
 and turned up the looking glass.
 As he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner.
 The man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out
 by the archway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment,
 stockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from the
 corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the balcony.
 They began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing had an unmistakable
 quality of anxiety.
 Over the purple under-garment came a I complex but graceful garment of
 bluish white, and I Graham was clothed in the fashion once more and saw
 himself, sallow-faced, unshaven and shaggy still, but at least naked no
 longer, and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I must shave," he said regarding himself in the glass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"In a moment," said Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The persistent stare ceased.
 The young man closed his eyes, reopened them, and with a lean hand extended,
 advanced on Graham.
 Then he stopped, with his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"A seat," said Howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded man
 had a chair behind Graham.
 "Sit down, please," said Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wildeyed man he saw the glint
 of steel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Don't you understand, Sire?" cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurried
 politeness.
 "He is going to cut your hair."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Oh!" cried Graham enlightened.
 "But you called him--- "A capillotomist---precisely ! He is one of the
 finest artists in the world."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham sat down abruptly.
 The flaxen-bearded man disappeared.
 The capillotomist came forward with graceful gestures, examined Graham's
 ears and surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would have sat down
 again to regard him but for Howard's audible impatience.
 Forthwith with rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements
 he shaved Graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and cut and arranged his
 hair.
 All this he did without a word, with something of the rapt air of a poet
 inspired.
 And as soon as he had finished Graham was handed a pair of shoes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly a loud voice shouted---it seemed from a piece of machinery in the
 corner---"At once---at once.
 The people know all over the city.
 Work is being stopped.
 Work is being stopped.
 Wait for nothing, but come."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly.
 By his gestures it seemed to Graham that he hesitated between two directions.
 Abruptly he went towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the
 little crystal ball.
 As he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the archway that
 had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound, roared
 as if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding swiftly.
 It drew Graham after it with an irresistible attraction.
 He glanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse.
 In two strides he was down the steps and in the passage, and, in a score
 he was out upon the balcony upon which | the three men had been standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Moving Ways
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward.
 An exclamation of surprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number
 of people came from the spacious area below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His first impression was of overwhelming architecture.
 The place into which he looked was an aisle of Titanic buildings, curving
 spaciously in either direction.
 Overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge width of the
 place, and a tracery of translucent material shut out the sky.
 Gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered
 down through the girders and wires.
 Here and there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers
 flung across the chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables.
 A cliff of edifice hung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and
 the opposite facade was grey and dim and broken by great archings, circular
 perforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vast
 windows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief.
 Athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar
 lettering.
 Here and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened,
 and drooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the opposite side
 of the space, and even as Graham noted these a remote and tiny figure of
 a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention.
 This little figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher
 fastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward from a little ledge
 of masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent from
 the line.
 Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent Graham's heart into his mouth, this
 man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round opening on the
 hither side of the way.
 Graham had been looking up as he came out upon the balcony, and the things
 he saw above and opposed to him had at first seized his attention to the
 exclusion of anything else.
 Then suddenly he discovered the roadway! It was not a roadway at all, as
 Graham understood such things, for in the nineteenth century the only roads
 and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling rivulets of
 vehicles between narrow footways.
 But this roadway was three hundred feet across, and it moved; it moved,
 all save the middle, the lowest part.
 For a moment, the motion dazzled his mind.
 Then he understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to Graham's right,
 an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century express train,
 an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with little
 interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures of the street.
 Upon it were seats, and here and there little kiosks, but they swept by
 too swiftly for him to see what might be therein.
 From this nearest and swiftest platform a series of others descended to
 the centre of the space.
 Each moved to the right, each perceptibly slower than the one above it,
 but the difference in pace was small enough to permit anyone to step from
 any platform to the one adjacent, and so walk uninterruptedly from the
 swiftest to the motionless middle way.
 Beyond this middle way was another series of endless platforms rushing
 with varying pace to Graham's left.
 And seated in crowds upon the two widest and swiftest platforms, or stepping
 from one to another down the steps, or swarming over the central space,
 was an innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must not stop here," shouted Howard suddenly at his side.
 "You must come away at once."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham made no answer.
 He heard without hearing.
 The platforms ran with a roar and the people were shouting.
 He perceived women and girls with flowing hair, beautifully robed, with
 bands crossing between the breasts.
 These first came out of the confusion.
 Then he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume
 was the pale blue that the tailor's boy had worn.
 He became aware of cries of "The Sleeper.
 What has happened to the Sleeper?" and it seemed as though the rushing
 platforms before him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of human
 faces, and then still more thickly.
 He saw pointing fingers.
 He perceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade just
 opposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blue-clad people.
 Some sort of struggle had sprung into life.
 People seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on either side, and
 carried away against their will.
 They would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick of the confusion,
 and run back towards the conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is the Sleeper.
 Verily it is the Sleeper," shouted voices.
 "That is never the Sleeper," shouted others.
 More and more faces were turned to him.
 At the intervals along this central area Graham noted openings, pits, apparentl
y the heads of staircases going down with people ascending out of them and
 descending into them.
 The struggle it seemed centred about the one of these nearest to him.
 People were running down the moving platforms to this, leaping dexterously
 from platform to platform.
 The clustering people on the higher platforms seemed to divide their interest
 between this point and the balcony.
 A number of sturdy little figures clad in a uniform of bright red, and
 working methodically together, were employed it seemed in preventing access
 to this descending staircase.
 About them a crowd was rapidly accumulating.
 Their brilliant colour contrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their
 antagonists, for the struggle was indisputable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm.
 And then suddenly Howard was gone and he stood alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He perceived that the cries of "The Sleeper" grew in volume, and that the
 people on the nearer platform were standing up.
 The nearer swifter platform he perceived was empty to the right of him,
 and far across the space the platform running in the opposite direction
 was coming crowded and passing away bare.
 With incredible swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space
 before his eyes; a dense swaying mass of people, and the shouts grew from
 a fitful crying to a voluminous incessant clamour: "The Sleeper!" The Sleeper!"
 and yells and cheers, a waving of garments and cries of "Stop the ways!"
 They were also crying another name strange to Graham.
 It sounded like "Ostrog." The slower platforms were soon thick with active
 people, running against the movement so as to keep themselves opposite
 to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Stop the ways," they cried.
 Agile figures ran up swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearest
 to him, were borne rapidly past him, shouting strange, unintelligible things,
 and ran back obliquely to the central way.
 One thing he distinguished: "It is indeed the Sleeper.
 It is indeed the Sleeper," they testified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a space Graham stood without a movement.
 Then he became vividly aware that all this concerned him.
 He was pleased at his wonderful popularity, he bowed, and, seeking a gesture
 of longer range, waved his arm.
 He was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked.
 The tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence.
 He became aware of crowded balconies, of men sliding along ropes, of men
 in trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space.
 He heard voices behind him, a number of people descending the steps through
 the archway; he suddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was back again
 and gripping his arm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned, and Howard's face was white.
 "Come back," he heard.
 "They will stop the ways.
 The whole city will be in confusion."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars
 behind Howard, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall
 man in vivid vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and all
 these people had anxious eager faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Get him away," cried Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But why?" said Graham.
 "I don't see---"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must come away!" said the man in red in a resolute voice.
 His face and eyes were resolute, too.
 Graham's glances went from face to face, and he was suddenly aware of that
 most disagreeable flavour in life, compulsion.
 Some one gripped his arm....
 He was being dragged away.
 It seemed as though the tumult suddenly became two, as if half the shouts
 that had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung into the passages
 of the great building behind him.
 Marvelling and confused, feeling an impotent desire to resist, Graham was
 half led, half thrust, along the passage of blue pillars, and suddenly
 he found himself alone with Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Hall of the Atlas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when
 Graham found himself in the lift, was altogether barely five minutes.
 And as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him, as yet
 the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched
 everything with wonder, with a sense of the irrational, with something
 of the quality of a realistic dream.
 He was still detached, an astonished spectator, still but half involved
 in life.
 What he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed in the
 setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing witnessed
 from the box of a theatre.
 "I don't understand," he said.
 "What was the trouble? My mind is in a whirl.
 Why were they shouting? What is the danger?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We have our troubles," said Howard.
 His eyes avoided Graham's enquiry.
 "This is a time of unrest.
 And, in fact, your appearance, your waking just now, has a sort of connexion---
"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing.
 He stopped abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I don't understand," said Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It will be clearer later," said Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the lift
 slow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen my way about a little,"
 said Graham puzzled.
 "It.
 will be---it is bound to be perplexing.
 At present it is all so strange.
 Anything seems possible.
 Anything In the details even.
 Your counting, I understand, is different."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long passage
 between high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and
 big cables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What a huge place this is!" said Graham.
 "Is it all one building? What place is it?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This is one of the city ways for various public services.
 Light and so forth."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Was it a social trouble---that---in the great roadway place? How are you
 governed? Have you still a police?" "Several," said Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Several? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"About fourteen."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I don't understand."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Very probably not.
 Our social order will probably seem very complex to you.
 To tell you the truth, I don't understand it myself very clearly.
 Nobody does.
 You will, perhaps---bye and bye.
 We have to go to the Council." Graham's attention was divided between the
 urgent necessity of his inquiries and the people in the passages and halls
 they were traversing.
 For a moment his mind would be concentrated upon Howard and the halting
 answers he made, and then he would lose the thread in response to some
 vivid unexpected impression.
 Along the passages, in the halls, half the people seemed to be men in the
 red uniform.
 The pale blue canvas that had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways
 did not appear.
 Invariably these men looked at him, and saluted him and Howard as they
 passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were a number
 of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class.
 He saw no teacher, but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice
 proceeded.
 The girls regarded him and his conductor, he thought, with curiosity and
 astonishment.
 But he was hurried on before he could form a clear idea of the gathering.
 He judged they knew Howard and not himself, and that they wondered who
 he was.
 This Howard, it seemed, was a person of importance.
 But then he was also merely Graham's guardian.
 That was odd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung so
 that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon,
 but no more of them.
 Then vague impressions of galleries and of casual astonished passers-by
 turning round to stare after the two of them with their red-clad guard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary.
 He was speedily fatigued by this excessive haste.
 He asked Howard to slacken his speed.
 Presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great street space,
 but this was glazed and did not open, and they were too high for him to
 see the moving platforms below.
 But he saw people going to and fro along cables and along strange, frail-lookin
g ridges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it.
 They crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass, so clear
 that it made him giddy even to remember it.
 The floor of it also was of glass.
 From his memory of the cliffs between New Quay and Boscastle, so remote
 in time, and so recent in his experience, it seemed to him that they must
 be near four hundred feet above the moving ways.
 He stopped, looked down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red
 multitudes, minute and fore- shortened, struggling and gesticulating still
 towards the little balcony far below, a little toy balcony, it seemed,
 where he had so recently been standing.
 A thin haze and the glare of the mighty globes of light obscured everything.
 A man seated in a little open- work cradle shot by from some point still
 higher than the little narrow bridge, rushing down a cable as swiftly almost
 as if he were falling.
 Graham stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish in
 a great circular opening below, and then his eyes went back to the tumultuous
 struggle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots.
 This broke up into individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring
 down the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central
 area.
 These men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons; they seemed
 to be striking and thrusting.
 A great shouting, cries of wrath, screaming, burst out and came up to Graham,
 faint and thin.
 "Go on," cried Howard, laying hands on him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another man rushed down a cable.
 Graham suddenly glanced up to see whence he came, and beheld through the
 glassy roof and the network of cables and girders, dim rhythmically passing
 forms like the vans of windmills, and between them glimpses of a remote
 and pallid sky.
 Then Howard had thrust him forward across the bridge, and he was in a little
 narrow passage decorated with geometrical patterns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I want to see more of that," cried Graham, resisting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"No, no," cried Howard, still gripping his arm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This way.
 You must go this way." And the men in red following them seemed ready to
 enforce his orders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared
 down the passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that had
 seemed a door to Graham, and led the way through it.
 Graham found himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber.
 The attendant in black and yellow crossed this, thrust up a second shutter
 and stood waiting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This place had the appearance of an ante-room.
 He saw a number of people in the central space, and at the opposite end
 a large and imposing doorway at the top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained
 but giving a glimpse of some still larger hall beyond.
 He perceived white men in red and other negroes in black and yellow standing
 stiffly about those portals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, "The Sleeper,"
 and was aware of a turning of heads, a hum of observation.
 They entered another little passage in the wall of this ante-chamber, and
 then he found himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that passed round
 the side of the great hall he had already seen through the curtains.
 He entered the place at the corner, so that he received the fullest impression
 of its huge proportions.
 The black in the wasp uniform stood aside like a well-trained servant,
 and closed the valve behind him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared with any of the places Graham had see thus far, this second hall
 appeared to be decorate with extreme richness.
 On a pedestal at the remote end, and more brilliantly lit than any other
 object, was a gigantic white figure of Atlas, strong and strenuous, the
 globe upon his bowed shoulders.
 It was the first thing to strike his attention, it was so vast, so patiently
 and painfully real, so white and simple.
 Save for this figure and for a dais in the centre, the wide floor of the
 place was a shining vacancy.
 The dais was remote in the greatness of the area; it would have looked
 a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group of seven men who stood
 about a table on it, and gave an inkling of its proportions.
 They were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to have arisen that moment
 from their seats, and they were regarding Graham steadfastly.
 At the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this mighty
 labouring figure.
 Then he stopped.
 The two men in red who had followed them into the gallery came and stood
 on either hand of Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must remain here," murmured Howard, "for a few moments," and, without
 waiting for a reply, hurried away along the gallery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But, 
\emph on
why?"
\emph default
 began Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path obstructed by one of
 the men in red.
 "You have to wait here, Sire," said the man in red.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
"Why?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Orders, Sire."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Whose orders? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Our orders, Sire."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham looked his exasperation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What place is this?" he said presently.
 "Who are those men? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"They are the lords of the Council, Sire."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What Council? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"
\emph on
The
\emph default
 Council."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Oh!" said Graham, and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other
 man, went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white, who stood
 watching him and whispering together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Council? He perceived there were now eight, though how the newcomer
 had arrived he had not observed.
 They made no gestures of greeting; they stood regarding him as in the nineteent
h century a group of men might have stood in the street regarding a distant
 balloon that had suddenly floated into view.
 What council could it be that gathered there, that little body of men beneath
 the significant white Atlas, secluded from every eavesdropper in this impressiv
e spaciousness? And why should he be brought to them, and be looked at strangely
 and spoken of inaudibly? Howard appeared beneath, walking quickly across
 the polished floor towards them.
 As he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar movements, apparently
 of a ceremonious nature.
 Then he ascended the steps of the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the
 end of the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham watched that visible inaudible conversation.
 Occasionally, one of the white-robed men would glance towards him.
 He strained his ears in vain.
 The gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated.
 He glanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants
\begin_inset ERT

 .
 When he looked again Howard was extending his hands and moving his head
 like a man who protests.
 He was interrupted, it seemed, by one of the white-robed men rapping the
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conversation lasted an interminable time to Graham's sense.
 His eyes rose to the still giant at whose feet the Council sat.
 Thence they wandered at last to the walls of the hall.
 It was decorated in long painted panels of a quasi-Japanese type, many
 of them very beautiful.
 These panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark metal,
 which passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries, and the great
 structural lines of the interior.
 The facile grace of these panels enhanced the mighty white effort that
 laboured in the centre of the scheme.
 Graham's eyes came back to the Council, and Howard was descending the steps.
 As he drew nearer his features could be distinguished, and Graham saw that
 he was flushed and blowing out his cheeks.
 His countenance was still disturbed when presently he reappeared along
 the gallery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This way," he said concisely, and they went on in silence to a little door
 that opened at their approach.
 The two men in red stopped on either side of this door.
 Howard and Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing back, saw the white-robed
 Council still standing in a close group and looking at him.
 Then the door closed behind him with a heavy thud, and for the first time
 since his awakening he was in silence.
 The floor, even, was noiseless to his feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Howard opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguous
 chambers furnished in white and green.
 "What Council was that? " began Graham.
 "What were they discussing? What have they to do with me?" Howard closed
 the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something in an undertone.
 He walked slanting ways across the room and turned, blowing out his cheeks
 again.
 "Ugh!" he grunted, a man relieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham stood regarding him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must understand," began Howard abruptly, avoiding Graham's eyes, "that
 our social order is very complex.
 A half explanation, a bare unqualified statement would give you false impressio
ns.
 As a matter of fact---it is a case of compound interest partly---your small
 fortune, and the fortune of your cousin Warming which was left to you---and
 certain other beginnings---have become very considerable.
 And in other ways that will be hard for you to understand, you have become
 a person of significance---of very considerable significance---involved
 in the world's affairs."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes?" said Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We have grave social troubles."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, is advisable to seclude
 you here."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Keep me prisoner! " exclaimed Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well---to ask you to keep in seclusion."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham turned on him.
 "This is strange!" he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"No harm will be done you."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"No harm ! "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But you must be kept here---" "While I learn my position, I presume."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Precisely."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Very well then.
 Begin.
 Why 
\emph on

\emph default
"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" Not now."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Why not? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is too long a story, Sire."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"All the more reason I should begin at once.
 You say I am a person of importance.
 What was that shouting I heard? Why is a great multitude shouting and excited
 because my trance is over, and who are the men in white in that huge council
 chamber? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"All in good time, Sire," said Howard.
 "But not crudely, not crudely.
 This is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind.
 Your awakening.
 No one expected your awakening.
 The Council is consulting."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What council? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The Council you saw."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham made a petulant movement.
 " This is not right," he said.
 " I should be told what is happening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You must wait.
 Really you must wait."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham sat down abruptly.
 "I suppose since I have waited so long to resume life," he said, "that
 I must wait a little longer."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That is better," said Howard.
 "Yes, that is much better.
 And I must leave you alone.
 For a space.
 While I attend the discussion in the Council.
 I am sorry."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in some
 way he never came to understand, turned about, paced the room restlessly,
 made the circuit of the room, and sat down.
 He remained sitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow, biting
 his finger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions
 of this first hour of awakened life; the vast mechanical spaces, the endless
 series of chambers and passages, the great struggle that roared and splashed
 through these strange ways, the little group of remote unsympathetic men
 beneath the colossal Atlas, Howard's mysterious behaviour.
 There was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in his mind---a vast
 inheritance perhaps misapplied---of some unprecedented importance and opportuni
ty.
 What had he to do? And this room's secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonmen
t!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It came into Graham's mind with irresistible conviction that this series
 of magnificent impressions was a dream.
 He tried to shut his eyes and succeeded, but that time-honoured device
 led to no awakening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments
 of the two small rooms in which he found himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished.
 He was clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with a little
 greyshot beard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked
 now with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but
 graceful manner.
 He seemed a man of five-and-forty perhaps.
 For a moment he did not perceive this was himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A flash of laughter came with the recognition.
 "To call on old Warming like this!" he exclaimed, "and make him take me
 out to lunch! "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few familiar
 acquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his amusement realised
 that every soul with whom he might jest had died many score of years ago.
 The thought smote him abruptly and keenly; he stopped short, the expression
 of his face changed to a white consternation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade of that
 wonderful street reasserted itself.
 The shouting multitudes came back clear and vivid, and those remote, inaudible,
 unfriendly councilors in white.
 He felt himself a little figure, very small and ineffectual, pitifully
 conspicuous.
 And all about him, the world was---strange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
In the Silent Rooms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presently Graham resumed his examination of his apartments.
 Curiosity kept him moving in spite of his fatigue.
 The inner room, he perceived, was high, and its ceiling dome shaped', with
 an oblong aperture in the centre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel
 of broad vans seemed to be rotating, apparently driving the air up the
 shaft.
 The faint humming note of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that
 quiet place.
 As these vans sprang up one after the other, Graham could get transient
 glimpses of the sky.
 He was surprised to see a star.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these rooms
 was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the cornices.
 There were no windows.
 And he began to recall that along all the vast chambers and passages he
 had traversed with Howard he had observed no windows at all.
 Had there been windows? There were windows on the street indeed, but were
 they for light? Or was the whole city lit day and night for evermore, so
 that there was no night there?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And another thing dawned upon him.
 There was no fireplace in either room.
 Was the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or was
 the whole City uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested in these
 questions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls, the simply
 constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedroom
 service was practically abolished.
 And over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare
 grace of form and colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye.
 There were several very comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners
 carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing
 a clear substance like jelly.
 Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no writing materials.
 "The world has changed indeed," he said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of peculiar
 double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that harmonized
 With the decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre of this side
 projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a white smooth
 face to the room.
 A chair faced this.
 He had a transitory idea that these cylinders might be books, or a modern
 substitute for books, but at first it did not seem so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lettering on the cylinders puzzled him.
 At first sight it seemed like Russian.
 Then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated English about certain of the
 words.
 "oi Man huwdbi Kin"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
forced itself on him as "The Man who would be King." "Phonetic spelling,"
 he said.
 He remembered reading a story with that title, then he recalled the story
 vividly, one of the best stories in the world.
 But this thing before him was not a book as he understood it.
 He puzzled out the titles of two adjacent cylinders.
 'The Heart of Darkness,' he had never heard of before nor 'The Madonna
 of the Future'---no doubt if they were indeed stories, they were by post
 Victorian authors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it.
 Then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that.
 He opened a sort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within, and
 on the upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell.
 He pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased.
 He became aware of voices and music, and noticed a play of colour on the
 smooth front face.
 He suddenly realised what this might be, and stepped back to regard it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured, and
 in this picture were figures that moved.
 Not only did they move, but they were conversing in clear small voices.
 It was exactly like reality viewed through an inverted opera glass and
 heard through a long tube.
 His interest was seized at once by the situation, which presented a man
 pacing up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant
 woman.
 Both were in the picturesque costume that seemed so strange to Graham.
 "I have worked," said the man, "but what have you been doing?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ah!" said Graham.
 He forgot everything else, and sat down in the chair.
 Within five minutes he heard himself named, heard "when the Sleeper wakes,"
 used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed himself
 by, a thing remote and incredible.
 But in a little while he knew those two people like l .
 intimate friends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of the apparatus
 was blank again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see, unscrupulous,
 pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire economic struggle;
 there were allusions he did not understand, incidents that conveyed strange
 suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of dubious enlightenment.
 The blue canvas that bulked so largely in his first impression of the city
 ways appeared again and again as the costume of the common people.
 He had no doubt the story was contemporary, and its intense realism was
 undeniable.
 And the end had been a tragedy that oppressed him.
 He sat staring at the blankness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He started and rubbed his eyes.
 He had been so absorbed in the latter-day substitute for a novel, that
 he awoke to the little green and white room with more than a touch of the
 surprise of his first awakening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland.
 The clearness of the kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the
 vast place of streets, the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking
 hour, came back.
 These people had spoken of the Council with suggestions of a vague universality
 of power.
 And they had spoken of the Sleeper; it had not really struck him vividly
 at the time that he was the Sleeper.
 He had to recall precisely what they had said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of
 the revolving fan.
 As the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery came
 in rhythmic eddies.
 All else was silence.
 Though the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he perceived
 the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep blue---black almost,
 with a dust of little stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He resumed his examination of the rooms.
 He could find no way of opening the padded door, no bell nor other means
 of calling for attendance.
 His feeling of wonder was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious for
 information.
 He wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new things.
 He tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to him.
 Presently he became restless and eager for information, for distraction,
 for fresh sensations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled out
 the method of replacing the cylinders by others.
 As he did so, it came into his mind that it must be these little appliances
 had fixed the language so that it was still clear and understand- able
 after two hundred years.
 The haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical fantasia.
 At first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous.
 He presently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version of
 the story of Tannhauser.
 The music was unfamiliar.
 But the rendering was realistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity.
 Tannhauser did not go to a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City.
 What was a Pleasure City? A dream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous
 writer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He became interested, curious.
 The story developed with a flavour of strangely twisted sentimentality.
 Suddenly he did not like it.
 He liked it less as it proceeded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had a revulsion of feeling.
 These were no pictures, no idealisations, but photographed realities.
 He wanted no more of the twenty-second century Venusberg.
 He forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth century art, and gave
 way to an archaic indignation.
 He rose, angry and half ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even
 in solitude.
 He pulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought for a means
 of stopping its action.
 Something snapped.
 A violet spark stung and convulsed his arm and the thing was still.
 When he attempted next day to replace these Tannhauser cylinders by another
 pair, he found the apparatus broken....
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro, struggling
 with intolerable vast impressions.
 The things he had derived from the cylinders and the things he had seen,
 conflicted, confused him.
 It seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty years
 of life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming times.
 "We were making the future," he said, "and hardly any of us troubled to
 think what future we were making.
 And here it is!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What have they got to, what has been done? How do I come into the midst
 of it all?" The vastness of street and house he was prepared for, the multitude
s of people.
 But conflicts in the city ways! And the systematised sensuality of a class
 of rich men!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic Utopia had so oddly
 anticipated this actual experience.
 But here was no Utopia, no Socialistic state.
 He had already seen enough to realise that the ancient antithesis of luxury,
 waste and sensuality on the one hand and abject poverty on the other, still
 prevailed.
 He knew enough of the essential factors of life to understand that correlation.
 And not only were the buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in
 the street gigantic, but the voices he had heard in the ways, the uneasiness
 of Howard, the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent.
 What country was he in? Still England it seemed, and yet strangely "un-English."
 His mind glanced at the rest of the world, and saw only an enigmatical
 veil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He prowled about his apartment, examining everything as a caged animal might
 do.
 He felt very tired, felt that feverish exhaustion that does not admit of
 rest.
 He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to catch some distant
 echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding in the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He began to talk to himself.
 "Two hundred and three years! " he said to himself over and over again,
 laughing stupidly.
 "Then I am two hundred and thirty-three years old! The oldest inhabitant.
 Surely they haven't reversed the tendency of our time and gone back to
 the rule of the oldest.
 My claims are indisputable.
 Mumble, mumble.
 I remember the Bulgarian atrocities as though it was yesterday.
 'Tis a great age! Ha ha!" He was surprised at first to hear himself laughing,
 and then laughed again deliberately and louder.
 Then he realised that he was behaving foolishly.
 "Steady," he said.
 "Steady!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His pacing became more regular.
 "This new world," he said.
 "I don't understand it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things Let me try and remember
 just how it began."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first thirty
 years had become.
 He remembered fragments, for the most part trivial moments, things of no
 great importance that he had observed.
 His boyhood seemed the most accessible at first, he recalled school books
 and certain lessons in mensuration.
 Then he revived the more salient features of his life, memories of the
 wife long since dead, her magic influence now gone beyond corruption, of
 his rivals and friends and betrayers, of the swift decision of this issue
 and that, and then of his , last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves,
 and at last of his strenuous studies.
 In a little while he perceived he had it all again; dim perhaps, like metal
 long laid aside, but in no way defective or injured, capable of re-polishing.
 And the hue of it was a deepening misery.
 Was it worth re-polishing? By a miracle he had been lifted out of a life
 that had become intolerable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He reverted to his present condition.
 He wrestled with the facts in vain.
 It became an inextricable tangle.
 He saw the sky through the ventilator pink with dawn.
 An old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his memory.
 "I must sleep," he said.
 It appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distress and from the
 growing pain and heaviness of his limbs.
 He went to the strange little bed, lay down and was presently asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments before
 he left them, for he remained imprisoned for three days.
 During that time no one, except Howard, entered his prison.
 The marvel of his fate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel
 of his survival.
 He had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this
 unaccountable solitude.
 Howard came regularly with subtly sustaining and nutritive fluids, and
 light and pleasant foods, quite strange to Graham.
 He always closed the door carefully as he entered.
 On matters of detail he was increasingly obliging, but the bearing of Graham
 on the great issues that were evidently being contested so closely beyond
 the soundproof walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate.
 He evaded, as politely as possible, every question on the position of affairs
 in the outer world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in those three days Graham's incessant thoughts went far and wide.
 All that he had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing,
 worked together in his mind.
 Almost every possible interpretation of his position he debated---even
 as it chanced, the right interpretation.
 Things that presently happened to him, came to him at last credible, by
 virtue of this seclusion.
 When at length the moment of his release arrived, it found him prepared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Howard's bearing went far to deepen Graham's impression of his own strange
 importance; the door between its opening and closing seemed to admit with
 him a breath of momentous happening.
 His enquiries became more definite and searching.
 Howard retreated through protests and difficulties.
 The awakening was unforeseen, he repeated; it happened to have fallen in
 with the trend of a social convulsion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"To explain it I must tell you the history of a gross and a half of years,"
 protested Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The thing is this," said Graham.
 "You are afraid of something I shall do.
 In some way I am arbitrator---I might be arbitrator."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" It is not that.
 But you have---I may tell you this much---the automatic increase of your
 property puts great possibilities of interference in your hands.
 And in certain other ways you have influence, with your eighteenth century
 notions."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nineteenth century," corrected Graham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as you are of every feature
 of our State."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Am I a fool? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Certainly not."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You were never expected to act at all.
 No one counted on your awakening.
 No one dreamt you would ever awake.
 The Council had surrounded you with antiseptic conditions.
 As a matter of fact, we thought that you were dead---a mere arrest of decay.
 And---but it is too complex.
 We dare not suddenly---while you are still half awake."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It won't do," said Graham.
 "Suppose it is as you say---why am I not being crammed night and day with
 facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit me for my responsibili
ties? Am I any wiser now than two days ago, if it is two days, when I awoke?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Howard pulled his lip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I am beginning to feel---every hour I feel more clearly---a sense of complex
 concealment of which you are the salient point.
 Is this Council, or committee, or whatever they are, cooking the accounts
 of my estate? Is that it? "
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That note of suspicion---" said Howard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
" Ugh!" said Graham.
 "Now, mark my words, it will be ill for those who have put me here.
 It will be ill.
 I am alive.
 Make no doubt of it, I am alive.
 Every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more vigorous.
