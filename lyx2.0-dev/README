INSTALLING SFFMS:

The sffms LaTeX class can be obtained from http://mcdemarco.net/sffms/, CTAN, or various repositories.

MikTex Tools is an easy way to install it. On Ubuntu, sffms is found in texlive-latex-extra.

INSTALLING LyX LAYOUTS:
Copy the layout files into your LyX layout directory. (/usr/share/lyx/layouts on Ubuntu). Open LyX and go to Tools > Reconfigure. Restart LyX.

USING:
1) Title, Author, etc. are added the same way you add a chapter. No editing the preamble.
2) Add an ellipsis (...) by going to Insert > Custom Insets > dots.
3) Add a Scene Break (enter, #, enter) by going to Insert > Custom Insets > New Scene.

ISSUES:
1) First paragraph must be indented. Currently, it isn't and using \usepackage{indentfirst} doesn't fix it for short story, but it does for novels. For short stories, add a part* prior to text and Insert > Formatting > Thinspace. This gives the correct result, but it's a hack!

See sffms docucmentation for other preamble options.

For novels with chapter titles, use chapter. For novels without chapter titles, use chapter*.
