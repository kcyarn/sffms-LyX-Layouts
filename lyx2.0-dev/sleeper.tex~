\chapter{Insomnia}

One afternoon, at low water, Mr. Isbister, a young artist lodging
at Boscastle, walked from that place to the picturesque cove of Pentargen,
desiring to examine the caves there. Halfway down the precipitous
path to the Pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man sitting in
an attitude of profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock.
The hands of this man hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red
and staring before him, and his face was wet with tears.

He glanced round at Isbister's footfall. Both men were disconcerted,
Isbister the more so, and, to override the awkwardness of his involuntary
pause, he remarked, with an air of mature conviction, that the weather
was hot for the time of year.

\textquotedbl{}Very,\textquotedbl{} answered the stranger shortly,
hesitated a second, and added in a colourless tone, \textquotedbl{}I
can't sleep.\textquotedbl{}

Isbister stopped abruptly. \textquotedbl{}No?\textquotedbl{} was all
he said, but his bearing conveyed his helpful impulse.

\textquotedbl{}It may sound incredible,\textquotedbl{} said the stranger,
turning weary eyes to Isbister's face and emphasizing his words with
a languid hand, \textquotedbl{}but I have had no sleep---no sleep
at all for six nights.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Had advice?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes. Bad advice for the most part. Drugs. My nervous
system\dots . They are all very well for the run of people. It's
hard to explain. I dare not take\dots sufficiently powerful drugs.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That makes it difficult,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister.

He stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed what to do. Clearly
the man wanted to talk. An idea natural enough under the circumstances,
prompted him to keep the conversation going. \textquotedbl{}I've never
suffered from sleeplessness myself,\textquotedbl{} he said in a tone
of commonplace gossip, \textquotedbl{}but in those cases I have known,
people have usually found something---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I dare make no experiments.\textquotedbl{}

He spoke wearily. He gave a gesture of rejection, and for a space
both men were silent.

\textquotedbl{}Exercise?\textquotedbl{} suggested Isbister diffidently,
with a glance from his interlocutor's face of wretchedness to the
touring costume he wore.

\textquotedbl{}That is what I have tried. Unwisely perhaps. I have
followed the coast, day after day---from New Quay. It has only added
muscular fatigue to the mental. The cause of this unrest was overwork---trouble.
There was something---\textquotedbl{}

He stopped as if from sheer fatigue. He rubbed his forehead with a
lean hand. He resumed speech like one who talks to himself.

\textquotedbl{}I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering through
a world in which I have no part. I am wifeless---childless---who is
it speaks of the childless as the dead twigs on the tree of life?
I am wifeless, I childless---I could find no duty to do. No desire
even in my heart. One thing at last I set myself to do.

\textquotedbl{}I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome the
inertia of this dull body, I resorted to drugs. Great God, I've had
enough of drugs! I don't know if \emph{you} feel the heavy inconvenience
of the body, its exasperating demand of time from the mind---time---life!
Live! We only live in patches. We have to eat, and then comes the
dull digestive complacencies---or irritations. We have to take the
air or else our thoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs and
blind alleys. A thousand distractions arise from within and without,
and then comes drowsiness and sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How
little of a man's day is his own---even at the best! And then come
those false friends, those Thug helpers, the alkaloids that stifle
natural fatigue and kill rest---black coffee, cocaine---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I see,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister.

\textquotedbl{}I did my work,\textquotedbl{} said the sleepless man
with a querulous intonation.

\textquotedbl{}And this is the price?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes.\textquotedbl{} For a little while the two remained
without speaking.

\textquotedbl{}You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel---a
hunger and thirst. For six long days, since my work was done, my mind
has been a whirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent
of thoughts leading nowhere, spinning round swift and steady---\textquotedbl{}

He paused. \textquotedbl{}Towards the gulf.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}You must sleep,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister decisively,
and with an air of a remedy discovered. \textquotedbl{}Certainly you
must sleep.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}My mind is perfectly lucid. It was never clearer. But
I know I am drawing towards the vortex. Presently---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of the light
of the day, out of this sweet world of sanity---down---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}But,\textquotedbl{} expostulated Isbister.

The man threw out a hand towards him, and his eyes were wild, and
his voice suddenly high. \textquotedbl{}I shall kill myself. If in
no other way---at the foot of yonder dark precipice there, where the
waves are green, and the white surge lifts and falls, and that little
thread of water trembles down. There at any rate is \dots sleep.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That's unreasonable,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister,
startled at the man's hysterical gust of emotion. \textquotedbl{}Drugs
are better than that.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}There at any rate is sleep,\textquotedbl{} repeated
the stranger, not heeding him.

Isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if some complex Providence
had indeed brought them together that afternoon. \textquotedbl{}It's
not a cert, you know,\textquotedbl{} he remarked. \textquotedbl{}
There's a cliff like that at Lulworth Cove---as high, anyhow---and
a little girl fell from top to bottom. And lives to-day---sound and
well.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}But those rocks there? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}One might lie on them rather dismally through a cold
night, broken bones grating as one shivered, chill water splashing
over you. Eh? \textquotedbl{}

Their eyes met. \textquotedbl{}Sorry to upset your ideals,\textquotedbl{}
said Isbister with a sense of devil-may-careish brilliance.

\textquotedbl{}But a suicide over that cliff (or any cliff for the
matter of that), really, as an artist---\textquotedbl{} He laughed.
\textquotedbl{}It's so damned amateurish.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}But the other thing,\textquotedbl{} said the sleepless
man irritably, \textquotedbl{}the other thing. No man can keep sane
if night after night---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Have you been walking along this coast alone? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Silly sort of thing to do. If you'll excuse my saying
so. Alone! As you say; body fag is no cure for brain fag. Who told
you to? No wonder; walking! And the sun on your head, heat, fag, solitude,
all the day long, and then, I suppose, you go to bed and try very
hard---eh?\textquotedbl{}

Isbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully.

\textquotedbl{}Look at these rocks!\textquotedbl{} cried the seated
man with a sudden force of gesture. \textquotedbl{}Look at that sea
that has shone and quivered there for ever! See the white spume rush
into darkness under that great cliff. And this blue vault, with the
blinding sun pouring from the dome of it. It is your world. You accept
it, you rejoice in it. It warms and supports and delights you. And
for me---\textquotedbl{}

He turned his head and showed a ghastly face, bloodshot pallid eyes
and bloodless lips. He spoke almost in a whisper. \textquotedbl{}It
is the garment of my misery. The whole world\dots is the garment
of my misery.\textquotedbl{}

Isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about
them and back to that face of despair For a moment he was silent.

He started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection. \textquotedbl{}You
get a night's sleep,\textquotedbl{} he said, \textquotedbl{}and you
won't see much misery out here. Take my word for it.\textquotedbl{}

He was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter. Only
half an hour ago he had been feeling horribly bored. Here was employment
the bare thought of which was righteous self-applause. He took possession
forthwith. It seemed to him that the first need of this exhausted
being was companionship He flung himself down on the steeply sloping
turf beside the motionless seated figure, and deployed forthwith into
a skirmishing line of gossip.

His hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy; he stared dismally seaward,
and spoke only in answer to Isbister's direct questions---and not
to all of those But he made no sign of objection to this benevolent
intrusion upon his despair.

In a helpless way he seemed even grateful, and when presently Isbister,
feeling that his unsupported talk was losing vigour, suggested that
they should reascend the steep and return towards Boscastle, alleging
the view into Blackapit, he submitted quietly. Halfway up he began
talking to himself, and abruptly turned a ghastly face on his helper.
\textquotedbl{}What can be happening?\textquotedbl{} he asked with
a gaunt illustrative hand. \textquotedbl{}What can be happening? Spin,
spin, spin, spin. It goes round and round, round and round for evermore.\textquotedbl{}

He stood with his hand circling

\textquotedbl{}It's all right, old chap,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister
with the air of an old friend. \textquotedbl{}Don't worry yourself.
Trust to me.\textquotedbl{}

The man dropped his hand and turned again. They went over the brow
in single file and to the headland beyond Penally, with the sleepless
man gesticulating ever and again, and speaking fragmentary things
concerning his whirling brain. At the headland they stood for a space
by the seat that looks into the dark mysteries of Blackapit, and then
he sat down. Isbister had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened
sufficiently for them to walk abreast. He was enlarging upon the complex
difficulty of making Boscastle Harbour in bad weather, when suddenly
and quite irrelevantly his companion interrupted him again.

\textquotedbl{}My head is not like what it was,\textquotedbl{} he
said, gesticulating for want of expressive phrases. \textquotedbl{}It's
not like what it was. There is a sort of oppression, a weight. No---not
drowsiness, would God it were! It is like a shadow, a deep shadow
falling suddenly and swiftly across something busy. Spin, spin into
the darkness The tumult of thought, the confusion, the eddy and eddy.
I can't express it. I can hardly keep my mind on it---steadily enough
to tell you.\textquotedbl{}

He stopped feebly.

\textquotedbl{} Don't trouble, old chap,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister.
\textquotedbl{}I think I can understand. At any rate, it don't matter
very much just at present about telling me, you know.\textquotedbl{}

The sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them.
Isbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then
he had a fresh idea. \textquotedbl{}Come down to my room,\textquotedbl{}
he said, \textquotedbl{}and try a pipe. I can show you some sketches
of this Blackapit. If you'd care? \textquotedbl{}

The other rose obediently and followed him down the steep.

Several times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his
movements were slow and hesitating. \textquotedbl{}Come in with me,\textquotedbl{}
said Isbister, \textquotedbl{}and try some cigarettes and the blessed
gift of alcohol. If you take alcohol?\textquotedbl{}

The stranger hesitated at the garden gate. He seemed no longer clearly
aware of his actions. \textquotedbl{}I don't drink,\textquotedbl{}
he said slowly, coming up the garden path, and after a moment's interval
repeated absently, \textquotedbl{}No---I don't drink. It goes round.
Spin, it goes---spin---\textquotedbl{}

He stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing
of one who sees nothing.

Then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy chair, seemed almost
to fall into it. He leant forward with his brows on his hands and
became motionless.

Presently he made a faint sound in his throat. Isbister moved about
the room with the nervousness of an inexperienced host, making little
remarks that scarcely required answering. He crossed the room to his
portfolio, placed it on the table and noticed the mantel clock.

\textquotedbl{}I don't know if you'd care to have supper with me,\textquotedbl{}
he said with an unlighted cigarette in his hand---his mind troubled
with a design of the furtive administration of chloral. \textquotedbl{}Only
cold mutton, you know, but passing sweet. Welsh. And a tart, I believe.\textquotedbl{}
He repeated this after momentary silence.

The seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped, match in hand, regarding
him.

The stillness lengthened. The match went out, the cigarette was put
down unlit. The man was certainly very still. Isbister took up the
portfolio, opened it, put it down, hesitated, seemed about to speak.
\textquotedbl{}Perhaps,\textquotedbl{} he whispered doubtfully. Presently
he glanced at the door and back to the figure. Then he stole on tiptoe
out of the room, glancing at his companion after each elaborate pace.

He closed the door noiselessly. The house door was standing open,
and he went out beyond the porch, and stood where the monkshood rose
at the corner of the garden bed. From this point he could see the
stranger through the open window, still and dim, sitting head on hand.
He had not moved.

A number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the
artist curiously. A boatman exchanged civilities with him. He felt
that possibly his circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar
and unaccountable. Smoking, perhaps, might seem more natural. He drew
pipe and pouch from his pocket, filled the pipe slowly.

\textquotedbl{}I wonder,\textquotedbl{} \dots he said, with a scarcely
perceptible loss of complacency. \textquotedbl{} At any rate we must
give him a chance.\textquotedbl{} He struck a match in the virile
way, and proceeded to light his pipe.

Presently he heard his landlady behind him, coming with his lamp lit
from the kitchen. He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped
her at the door of his sitting-room. He had some difficulty in explaining
the situation in whispers, for she did not know he had a visitor.
She retreated again with the lamp, still a little mystified to judge
from her manner, and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the
porch, flushed and less at his ease.

Long after he had smoked out his pipe, and when the bats were abroad,
his curiosity dominated his complex hesitations, and he stole back
into his darkling sitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The stranger
was still in the same attitude, dark against the window. Save for
the singing of some sailors aboard one of the little slate-carrying
ships in the harbour, the evening was very still. Outside, the spikes
of monkshood and delphinium stood erect and motionless against the
shadow of the hillside. Something flashed into Isbister's mind; he
started, and leaning over the table, listened. An unpleasant suspicion
grew stronger; became conviction. Astonishment seized him and became---dread!

No sound of breathing came from the seated figure!

He crept slowly and noiselessly round the table, pausing twice to
listen. At last he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair.
He bent down until the two heads were ear to ear.

Then he bent still lower to look up at his visitor's face. He started
violently and uttered an exclamation. The eyes were void spaces of
white.

He looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled
under the lids. He was suddenly afraid. Overcome by the strangeness
of the man's condition, he took him by the shoulder and shook him.
\textquotedbl{}Are you asleep?\textquotedbl{} he said, with his voice
jumping into alto, and again, \textquotedbl{}Are you asleep?\textquotedbl{}

A conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead. He
suddenly became active and noisy, strode across the room, blundering
against the table as he did so, and rang the bell.

\textquotedbl{}Please bring a light at once,\textquotedbl{} he said
in the passage. \textquotedbl{}There is something wrong with my friend.\textquotedbl{}

Then he returned to the motionless seated figure, grasped the shoulder,
shook it, and shouted. The room was flooded with yellow glare as his
astonished landlady entered with the light. His face was white as
he turned blinking towards her. \textquotedbl{}I must fetch a doctor
at once,\textquotedbl{} he said. \textquotedbl{}It is either death
or a fit. Is there a doctor in the village? Where is a doctor to be
found? \textquotedbl{}


\chapter{The Trance}

The state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen, lasted
for an unprecedented length of time, and then he passed slowly to
the flaccid state, to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose.
Then it was his eyes could be closed.

He was removed from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the
surgery, after some weeks, to London. But he still resisted every
attempt at reanimation. After a time, for reasons that will appear
later, these attempts were discontinued. For a great space he lay
in that strange condition, inert and still neither dead nor living
but, as it were, suspended, hanging midway between nothingness and
existence. His was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation,
a dreamless inanition, a vast space of peace. The tumult of his mind
had swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence. Where was the
man? Where is any man when insensibility takes hold of him?

\textquotedbl{}It seems only yesterday,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister.
\textquotedbl{}I remember it all as though it happened yesterday---clearer
perhaps, than if it had happened yesterday.\textquotedbl{}

It was the Isbister of the last chapter, but he was no longer a young
man. The hair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the fashionable
length, was iron grey and clipped close, and the face that had been
pink and white was buff and ruddy. He had a pointed beard shot with
grey. He talked to an elderly man who wore a summer suit of drill
(the summer of that year was unusually hot). This was Warming, a London
solicitor and next of kin to Graham, the man who had fallen into the
trance. And the two men stood side by side in a room in a house in
London regarding his recumbent figure.

It was a yellow figure Iying lax upon a water-bed and clad in a flowing
shirt, a figure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard, lean limbs
and lank nails, and about it was a case of thin glass. This glass
seemed to mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him,
he was a thing apart, a strange, isolated abnormality. The two men
stood close to the glass, peering in.

\textquotedbl{}The thing gave me a shock,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister
\textquotedbl{}I feel a queer sort of surprise even now when I think
of his white eyes. They were white, you know, rolled up. Coming here
again brings it all back to me.

\textquotedbl{}Have you never seen him since that time? \textquotedbl{}
asked Warming.

\textquotedbl{}Often wanted to come,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister;
\textquotedbl{}but business nowadays is too serious a thing for much
holiday keeping. I've been in America most of the time.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}If I remember rightly,\textquotedbl{} said Warming,
\textquotedbl{}you were an artist?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Was. And then I became a married man. I saw it was
all up with black and white, very soon---at least for a mediocre man,
and I jumped on to process. Those posters on the Cliffs at Dover are
by my people.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Good posters,\textquotedbl{} admitted the solicitor,
\textquotedbl{}though I | was sorry to see them there.\textquotedbl{}
I

\textquotedbl{}Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary,\textquotedbl{}
exclaimed Isbister with satisfaction. \textquotedbl{} The world changes.
When he fell asleep, twenty years ago, I was down at Boscastle with
a box of water-colours and a noble, old-fashioned ambition. I didn't
expect that some day my pigments would glorify the whole blessed coast
of England, from Land's End round again to the Lizard. Luck comes
to a man very often when he's not looking.\textquotedbl{}

Warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck. \textquotedbl{} I
just missed seeing you, if I recollect aright.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford
railway station. It was close on the Jubilee, Victoria's Jubilee,
because I remember the seats and flags in Westminster, and the row
with the cabman at Chelsea.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}The Diamond Jubilee, it was,\textquotedbl{} said Warming;
\textquotedbl{}the second one.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Ah, yes ! At the proper Jubilee---the Fifty Year affair---I
was down at Wookey---a boy. I missed all that\dots . What a fuss
we had with him! My landlady wouldn't take him in, wouldn't let him
stay---he looked so queer when he was rigid. We had to carry him in
a chair up to the hotel. And the Boscastle doctor---it wasn't the
present chap, but the G.P. before him---was at him until nearly two,
with, me and the landlord holding lights and so forth.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It was a cataleptic rigour at first, wasn't it?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Stiff!---wherever you bent him he stuck. You might
have stood him on his head and he'd have stopped. I never saw such
stiffness. Of course this\textquotedbl{}---he indicated the prostrate
figure by a movement of his head---\textquotedbl{} is quite different.
And, of course, the little doctor---what was his name?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Smithers? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Smithers it was---was quite wrong in trying to fetch
him round too soon, according to all accounts. The things he did.
Even now it makes me feel all---ugh! Mustard, snuff, pricking. And
one of those beastly little things, not dynamos---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Induction coils.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes. You could see his muscles throb and jump, and
he twisted about. There was just two flaring yellow candles, and all
the shadows were shivering, and the little doctor nervous and putting
on side, and him---stark and squirming in the most unnatural ways.
Well, it made me dream.\textquotedbl{}

Pause.

\textquotedbl{}It's a strange state,\textquotedbl{} said Warming.

\textquotedbl{} It's a sort of complete absence,\textquotedbl{} said
Isbister.

\textquotedbl{}Here's the body, empty. Not dead a bit, and yet not
alive. It's like a seat vacant and marked 'engaged.' No feeling, no
digestion, no beating of the heart---not a flutter. \emph{That} doesn't
make me feel as if there was a man present. In a sense it's more dead
than death, for these doctors tell me that even the hair has stopped
growing. Now with the proper dead, the hair will go on growing---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I know,\textquotedbl{} said Warming, with a flash of
pain in his expression.

They peered through the glass again. Graham was indeed in a strange
state, in the flaccid phase of a trance, but a trance unprecedented
in medical history. Trances had lasted for as much as a year before---but
at the end of that time it had ever been waking or a death; sometimes
first one and then the other. Isbister noted the marks the physicians
had made in injecting nourishment, for that device had been resorted
to to postpone collapse; he pointed them out to Warming, who had been
trying not to see them.

\textquotedbl{}And while he has been Iying here,\textquotedbl{} said
Isbister, with the zest of a life freely spent, \textquotedbl{} I
have changed my plans in life; married, raised a family, my eldest
lad---I hadn't begun to think of sons then---is an American citizen,
and looking forward to leaving Harvard. There's a touch of grey in
my hair. And this man, not a day older nor wiser (practically) than
I was in my downy days. It's curious to think of.\textquotedbl{}

Warming turned. \textquotedbl{}And I have grown old too. I played
cricket with him when I was still only a lad. And he looks a young
man still. Yellow perhaps. But that is a young man nevertheless.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}And there's been the War,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister.

\textquotedbl{}From beginning to end.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}And these Martians.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I've understood,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister after
a pause, \textquotedbl{}that he had some moderate property of his
own?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That is so,\textquotedbl{} said Warming. He coughed
primly. \textquotedbl{}As it happens---have charge of it.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{} Ah!\textquotedbl{} Isbister thought, hesitated and
spoke: \textquotedbl{}No doubt---his keep here is not expensive---no
doubt it will have improved---accumulated?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It has. He will wake up very much better off---if he
wakes---than when he slept.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}As a business man,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister, \textquotedbl{}that
thought has naturally been in my mind. I have, indeed, sometimes thought
that, speaking commercially, of course, this sleep may be a very good
thing for him. That he knows what he is about, so to speak, in being
insensible so long. If he had lived straight on---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I doubt if he would have premeditated as much,\textquotedbl{}
said Warming. \textquotedbl{}He was not a far-sighted man. In fact---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}We differed on that point. I stood to him some- what
in the relation of a guardian. You have probably seen enough of affairs
to recognise that occasionally a certain friction---. But even if
that was the case, there is a doubt whether he will ever wake. This
sleep exhausts slowly, but it exhausts. Apparently he is sliding slowly,
very slowly and tediously, down a long slope, if you can understand
me? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It will be a pity to lose his surprise. There's been
a lot of change these twenty years. It's Rip Van Winkle come real.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It's Bellamy,\textquotedbl{} said Warming. \textquotedbl{}
There has been a lot of change certainly. And, among other changes,
I have changed. I am an old man.\textquotedbl{}

Isbister hesitated, and then feigned a belated surprise. \textquotedbl{}I
shouldn't have thought it.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I was forty-three when his bankers---you remember you
wired to his bankers---sent on to me.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I got their address from the cheque book in his pocket,\textquotedbl{}
said Isbister.

\textquotedbl{}Well, the addition is not difficult,\textquotedbl{}
said Warming.

There was another pause, and then Isbister gave way to an unavoidable
curiosity. \textquotedbl{}He may go on for years yet,\textquotedbl{}
he said, and had a moment of hesitation. \textquotedbl{}We have to
consider that. His affairs, you know, may fall some day into the hands
of---someone else, you know.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That, if you will believe me, Mr. Isbister, is one
of the problems most constantly before my mind. We happen to be---as
a matter of fact, there are no very trustworthy connections of ours.
It is a grotesque and unprecedented position.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It is,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister. \textquotedbl{}As
a matter of fact, it's a case for a public trustee, if only we had
such a functionary.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It seems to me it's a case for some public body, some
practically undying guardian. If he really is going on living---as
the doctors, some of them, think. As a matter of fact, I have gone
to one or two public men about it. But, so far, nothing has been done.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It wouldn't be a bad idea to hand him over to some
public body---the British Museum Trustees, or the Royal College of
Physicians. Sounds a bit odd, of course, but the whole situation is
odd.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}The difficulty is to induce them to take him.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Red tape, I suppose? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Partly.\textquotedbl{}

Pause. \textquotedbl{} It's a curious business, certainly,\textquotedbl{}
said Isbister. \textquotedbl{}And compound interest has a way of mounting
up.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It has,\textquotedbl{} said Warming. \textquotedbl{}And
now the gold supplies are running short there is a tendency towards
\dots appreciation.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I've felt that,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister with a
grimace. \textquotedbl{}But it makes it better for him.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}If he wakes.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}If he wakes,\textquotedbl{} echoed Isbister. \textquotedbl{}Do
you notice the pinched-ill look of his nose, and the way in which
his eyelids sink?\textquotedbl{}

Warming looked and thought for a space. \textquotedbl{}I doubt if
he will wake,\textquotedbl{} he said at last.

\textquotedbl{}I never properly understood,\textquotedbl{} said Isbister,
\textquotedbl{}what it was brought this on. He told me something about
overstudy. I've often been curious.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}He was a man of considerable gifts, but spasmodic,
emotional. He had grave domestic troubles, divorced his wife, in fact,
and it was as a relief from that, I think, that he took up politics
of the rabid sort. He was a fanatical Radical---a Socialist---or typical
Liberal, as they used to call themselves,-of the advanced school.
Energetic---flighty---undisciplined. Overwork upon a controversy did
this for him. I remember the pamphlet he wrote---a curious production.
Wild, whirling stuff. There were one or two prophecies. Some of them
are already exploded, some of them are established facts. But for
the most part to read such a thesis is to realise how full the world
is of unanticipated things. He will have much to learn, much to unlearn,
when he wakes. If ever a waking comes.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I'd give anything to be there,\textquotedbl{} said
Isbister, \textquotedbl{}just to hear what he would say to it all.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}So would I,\textquotedbl{} said Warming. \textquotedbl{}Aye!
so would I,\textquotedbl{} with an old man's sudden turn to self pity.
\textquotedbl{}But I shall never see him wake.\textquotedbl{}

He stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure. \textquotedbl{}He
will never wake,\textquotedbl{} he said at last. He sighed \textquotedbl{}He
will never wake again.\textquotedbl{}


\chapter{The Awakening}

But Warming was wrong in that. An awakening came.

What a wonderfully complex thing! this simple seeming unity---the
self! Who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we
awaken, the flux and confluence of its countless factors intenveaving,
rebuilding, the dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis
of the unconscious to the subconscious, the sub-conscious to dawning
consciousness, until at last we recognise ourselves again. And as
it happens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with Graham
at the end of his vast slumber. A dim cloud of sensation taking shape,
a cloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent,
faint, but alive.

The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs,
to occupy epochs. Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at
the time, left vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange
scenery, as if from another planet. There was a distinct impression,
too, of a momentous conversation, of a name---he could not tell what
name---that was subsequently to recur, of some queer long-forgotten
sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort,
the effort of a man near drowning in darkness. Then came a panorama
of dazzling unstable confluent scenes.

Graham became aware his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar
thing.

It was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood. He
moved his head slightly, following the contour of this shape. It went
up beyond the top of his eyes. He tried to think where he might be.
Did it matter, seeing he was so wretched? The colour of his thoughts
was a dark depression. He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes
towards the hour of dawn. He had an uncertain sense of whispers and
footsteps hastily receding.

The movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical
weakness. He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the
valley---but he could not recall that white edge. He must have slept.
He remembered now that he had wanted to sleep. He recalled the cliff
and waterfall again, and then recollected something about talking
to a passer-by.

How long had he slept? What was that sound of pattering feet? And
that rise and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put
out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was
his habit to place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass.
This was so unexpected that it startled him extremely. Quite suddenly
he rolled over, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting
position. The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy
and weak---and amazed.

He rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but
his mind was quite clear---evidently his sleep had benefited him.
He was not in a bed at all as he understood the word, but Iying naked
on a very soft and yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass. The
mattress was partly transparent, a fact he observed with a strange
sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly.
About his arm---and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangIy
dry and yellow---was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so
cunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below. And
this strange bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as
it seemed to him), a bar in the white framework of which had first
arrested his attention. In the corner of the case was a stand of glittering
and delicately made apparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances,
though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable.

The slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance which surrounded
him on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was
a vast apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and
simple white archway facing him. Close to the walls of the cage were
articles of furniture, a table covered with a silvery cloth, silvery
like the side of a fish, a couple of graceful chairs, and on the table
a number of dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle and two
glasses. He realised that he was intensely hungry.

He could see no human being, and after a period of hesitation scrambled
off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white
floor of his little apartment. He had miscalculated his strength,
however, and staggered and put his hand against the glasslike pane
before him to steady himself. For a moment it resisted his hand, bending
outward like a distended bladder, then it broke with a slight report
and vanished---a pricked bubble. He reeled out into the general space
of the hall, greatly astonished. He caught at the table to save himself,
knocking one of the glasses to the floor---it rang but did not break---and
sat down in one of the armchairs.

When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from
the bottle and drank---a colourless liquid it was, but not water,
with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support
and stimulus. He put down the vessel and looked about him.

The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the
greenish transparency that had intervened was removed. The archway
he saw led to a flight of steps, going downward without the intermediation
of a door, to a spacious transverse passage. This passage ran between
polished pillars of some white-veined substance of deep ultramarine,
and along it came the sound of human movements and voices and a deep
undeviating droning note. He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly,
forgetting the viands in his attention.

Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about
him for covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs
beside him. This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.

His mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly he had slept. and
had been removed in his sleep. But here? And who were those people,
the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured
out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid.

What was this place?---this place that to his senses seemed subtly
quivering like a thing alive? He looked about him at the clean and
beautiful form of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that
the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light,
and, as he looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed,
and came again and passed. \textquotedbl{}Beat, beat,\textquotedbl{}
that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that
filled the air.

He would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat.
Then he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made
his way towards the archway. He staggered down the steps, tripped
on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and
saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars.

The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple, and ended remotely
in a railed space like a balcony, brightly lit and projecting into
a space of haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building.
Beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms. The tumult
of voices rose now loud and clear, and on the balcony and with their
backs to him, gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation,
were three figures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright
soft colourings. The noise of a great multitude of people poured up
over the balcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and
once some brightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown
up into the air perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell. The shouts
sounded like English, there was a reiteration of \textquotedbl{}Wake!\textquotedbl{}
He heard some indistinct shrill cry, and abruptly the three men began
laughing.

\textquotedbl{}Ha, ha, ha!\textquotedbl{} laughed one---a red-haired
man in a short purple robe. \textquotedbl{}When the Sleeper wakes---\emph{When!}

He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage. His face changed,
the whole man changed, became rigid. The other two turned swiftly
at his exclamation and stood motionless. Their faces assumed an expression
of consternation, an expression that deepened into awe.

Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar
collapsed limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.


\chapter{The Sound of Tumult}

Graham's last impression before he fainted was of a clamorous ringing
of bells. He learnt afterwards that he was insensible, hanging between
life and death, for the better part of an hour. When he recovered
his senses, he was back on his translucent couch, and there was a
stirring warmth at heart and throat. The dark apparatus, he perceived,
had been removed from his arm, which was bandaged. The white framework
was still about him, but the greenish transparent substance that had
filled it was altogether gone. A man in a deep violet robe, one of
those who had been on the balcony, was looking keenly into his face.

Remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds, that
suggested to his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting
together. Something seemed to fall across this tumult, a door suddenly
closed.

Graham moved his head. \textquotedbl{}What does this all mean?\textquotedbl{}
he said slowly. \textquotedbl{}Where am I?\textquotedbl{}

He saw the red-haired man who had been first to discover him. A voice
seemed to be asking what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.

The man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking English with
a slightly foreign accent, or so at least it seemed to the Sleeper's
ears, \textquotedbl{}You are quite safe.

You were brought hither from where you fell asleep. It is quite safe.
You have been here some time---sleeping. In a trance.\textquotedbl{}

He said something further that Graham could not hear, and a little
phial was handed across to him. Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant
mist played over his forehead for a moment, and his sense of refreshment
increased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.

\textquotedbl{} Better?\textquotedbl{} asked the man in violet, as
Graham's eyes reopened. He was a pleasant-faced man of thirty, perhaps,
with a pointed flaxen beard, and a clasp of gold at the neck of his
violet robe.

\textquotedbl{}Yes,\textquotedbl{} said Graham.

\textquotedbl{}You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic trance.
You have heard? Catalepsy? It may seem strange to you at first, but
I can assure you everything is well.\textquotedbl{}

Graham did not answer, but these words served their reassuring purpose.
His eyes went from face to face of the three people about him. They
were regarding him strangely. He knew he ought to be somewhere in
Cornwall, but he could not square these things with that impression.

A matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments
at Boscastle recurred, a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected.
He cleared his throat.

\textquotedbl{}Have you wired my cousin?\textquotedbl{} he asked.
\textquotedbl{}E. Warming, 27, Chancery Lane? \textquotedbl{}

They were all assiduous to hear. But he had to repeat it. \textquotedbl{}What
an odd \emph{blurr} in his accent!\textquotedbl{} whispered the red-haired
man. \textquotedbl{}Wire, sir?\textquotedbl{} said the young man with
the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.

\textquotedbl{}He means send an electric telegram,\textquotedbl{}
volunteered the third, a pleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty.
The flaxen-bearded man gave a cry of comprehension. \textquotedbl{}How
stupid of me! You may be sure everything shall be done, sir,\textquotedbl{}
he said to Graham. \textquotedbl{}I am afraid it would be difficult
to---wire to your cousin. He is not in London now. But don't trouble
about arrangements yet; you have been asleep a very long time and
the important thing is to get over that, sir.\textquotedbl{} (Graham
concluded the word was sir, but this man pronounced it \textquotedbl{}Sire.\textquotedbl{})

\textquotedbl{}Oh!\textquotedbl{} said Graham, and became quiet.

It was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar
dress knew what they were about. Yet they were odd and the room was
odd. It seemed he was in some newly established place. He had a sudden
flash of suspicion. Surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition!
If it was he would give Warming a piece of his mind. But it scarcely
had that character. And in a place of public exhibition he would not
have discovered himself naked.

Then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened. There
was no perceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge.
Abruptly he knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as
if by some processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in
the faces that peered into his. He looked at them strangely, full
of intense emotion. It seemed they read his eyes. He framed his lips
to speak and could not. A queer impulse to hide his knowledge came
into his mind almost at the moment of his discovery. He looked at
his bare feet, regarding then silently. His impulse to speak passed.
He was trembling exceedingly.

They gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty
taste, and the assurance of returning strength grew.

\textquotedbl{}That---that makes me feel better,\textquotedbl{} he
said hoarsely, and there were murmurs of respectful approval. He knew
now quite clearly. He made to speak again, and again he could not.

He pressed his throat and tried a third time.

\textquotedbl{}How long? \textquotedbl{} he asked in a level voice.
\textquotedbl{}How long have I been asleep? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Some considerable time,\textquotedbl{} said the flaxen-bearded
man, glancing quickly at the others.

\textquotedbl{}How long? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}A very long time.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes---yes,\textquotedbl{} said Graham, suddenly testy.
\textquotedbl{}But I want---Is it---it is---some years? Many years?
There was something---I forget what. I feel---confused. But you---\textquotedbl{}
He sobbed. \textquotedbl{}You need not fence with me. How long---?\textquotedbl{}

He stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed his eyes with his knuckles
and sat waiting for an answer.

They spoke in undertones.

\textquotedbl{}Five or six?\textquotedbl{} he asked faintly. \textquotedbl{}More?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Very much more than that.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Morel \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}More.\textquotedbl{}

He looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the
muscles of his face. He looked his question.

\textquotedbl{}Many years,\textquotedbl{} said the man with the red
beard.

Graham struggled into a sitting position. He wiped a rheumy tear from
his face with a lean hand. \textquotedbl{}Many years!\textquotedbl{}
he repeated. He shut his eyes tight, opened them, and sat looking
about him, from one unfamiliar thing to another.

\textquotedbl{}How many years?\textquotedbl{} he asked.

\textquotedbl{}You must be prepared to be surprised.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Well? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}More than a gross of years.\textquotedbl{}

He was irritated at the strange word.\textquotedbl{} More than a \emph{what}?\textquotedbl{}

Two of them spoke together. Some quick remarks that were made about
\textquotedbl{}decimal\textquotedbl{} he did not catch.

\textquotedbl{}How long did you say? \textquotedbl{} asked Graham.
\textquotedbl{}How long? Don't look like that. Tell me.\textquotedbl{}

Among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: \textquotedbl{}More
than a couple of centuries.\textquotedbl{}

\emph{\textquotedbl{}Whats?\textquotedbl{}} he cried, turning on the
youth who he thought had spoken. \textquotedbl{}Who says---? What
was that? A couple of centuries!\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes,\textquotedbl{} said the man with the red beard.
\textquotedbl{}Two hundred years.\textquotedbl{}

Graham repeated the words. He had been prepared to hear of a vast
repose, and yet these concrete centuries defeated him.

\textquotedbl{}Two hundred years,\textquotedbl{} he said again, with
the figure of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind; and then,
\textquotedbl{}Oh, but---!\textquotedbl{}

They said nothing.

\textquotedbl{}You---did you say---? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Two hundred years. Two centuries of years,\textquotedbl{}
said the man with the red beard.

There was a pause. Graham looked at their faces and saw that what
he had heard was indeed true.

\textquotedbl{}But it can't be,\textquotedbl{} he said querulously.
\textquotedbl{}I am dreaming. Trances. Trances don't last. That is
not right---this is a joke you have played upon me! Tell me---some
days ago, perhaps, I was walking along the coast of Cornwall---? \textquotedbl{}

His voice failed him.

The man with the flaxen beard hesitated. \textquotedbl{}I'm not very
strong in history, sir,\textquotedbl{} he said weakly, and glanced
at the others.

\textquotedbl{}That was it, sir,\textquotedbl{} said the youngster.
\textquotedbl{}Boscastle, in the old Duchy of Cornwall---it's in the
southwest country beyond the dairy meadows. There is a house there
still. I have been there.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Boscastle!\textquotedbl{} Graham turned his eyes to
the youngster. \textquotedbl{}That was it---Boscastle. Little Boscastle.
I fell asleep---somewhere there. I don't exactly remember. I don't
exactly remember.\textquotedbl{}

He pressed his brows and whispered,\textquotedbl{} More than two hundred
years!\textquotedbl{} I

He began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was
cold within him. \textquotedbl{}But if it is two hundred years, every
soul I know, every human being that ever I saw or spoke to before
I went to sleep, must be dead.\textquotedbl{}

They did not answer him.

\textquotedbl{}The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, of Church
and State. High and low, rich and poor, one with another---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Is there England still?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That's a comfort! Is there London?\textquotedbl{} E
\textquotedbl{}This \emph{is} London, eh? And you are my assistant---custodian;
assistant-custodian. And these---? Eh? Assistant-custodians to?\textquotedbl{}

He sat with a gaunt stare on his face. \textquotedbl{}But why am I
here? No! Don't talk. Be quiet. Let me---\textquotedbl{}

He sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another
little glass of pinkish fluid held towards him. He took the dose.
It was almost immediately sustaining. Directly he had taken it he
began to weep naturally and refreshingly.

Presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears,
a little foolishly. \textquotedbl{}But---two---hun---dred---years
! \textquotedbl{} he said. He grimaced hysterically and covered up
his face again.

After a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands hanging over his
knees in almost precisely the same attitude in which Isbister had
found him on the cliff at Pentargen. His attention was attracted by
a thick domineering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage.
\textquotedbl{}What are you doing? Why was I not warned? Surely you
could tell? Someone will suffer for this. The man must be kept quiet.
Are the doorways closed? All the doorways? He must be kept perfectly
quiet. He must not be told. Has he been told anything?\textquotedbl{}

The man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham
looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and thickset
beardless man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very thick
black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose
and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression.
He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard returned to the
man with the flaxen beard. \textquotedbl{}These others,\textquotedbl{}
he said in a voice of extreme irritation. \textquotedbl{}You had better
go.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Go? \textquotedbl{} said the red-bearded man.

\textquotedbl{}Certainly---go now. But see the doorways are closed
as you go.\textquotedbl{}

The two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance
at Graham, and instead of going through the archway as he expected,
walked straight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway.
And then came a strange thing; a long strip of this apparently solid
wall rolled up with a snap, hung over the two retreating men and fell
again, and immediately Graham was alone with the new comer and the
purple-robed man with the flaxen beard.

For a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham,
but proceeded to interrogate the other---obviously his subordinate---upon
the treatment of their charge. He spoke clearly, but in phrases only
partially intelligible to Graham. The awakening seemed not only a
matter of surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him. He was
evidently profoundly excited.

\textquotedbl{}You must not confuse his mind by telling him things,\textquotedbl{}
he repeated again and again. \textquotedbl{}You must not confuse his
mind.\textquotedbl{}

His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper
with an ambiguous expression.

\textquotedbl{}Feel queer? \textquotedbl{} he asked.

\textquotedbl{}Very.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?
\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I suppose so, now.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes?
\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}They---\textquotedbl{} said the thickset man and stopped,
and the flaxen-bearded man met his eye and went away. \textquotedbl{}You
will very speedily have clothes,\textquotedbl{} said the thickset
man.

\textquotedbl{}Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred---?\textquotedbl{}
asked Graham.

\textquotedbl{}They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and
three, as a matter of fact.\textquotedbl{}

Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed
mouth. He sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, \textquotedbl{}Is
there a mill or dynamo near here?\textquotedbl{} He did not wait for
an answer. \textquotedbl{}Things have changed tremendously, I suppose?\textquotedbl{}
he said.

\textquotedbl{}What is that shouting? \textquotedbl{} he asked abruptly.

\textquotedbl{}Nothing,\textquotedbl{} said the thickset man impatiently.
\textquotedbl{}It's people. You'll understand better later---perhaps.
As you say, things have changed.\textquotedbl{} He spoke shortly,
his brows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man trying to
decide in an emergency. \textquotedbl{}We must get you clothes and
so forth, at any rate.

Better wait here until some can come. No one will come near you. You
want shaving.\textquotedbl{}

Graham rubbed his chin.

The man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly,
listened for a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried
off through the archway towards the balcony. The tumult of shouting
grew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened also. He cursed
suddenly under his breath, and turned his eyes upon Graham with an
unfriendly expression. It was a surge of many voices, rising and falling,
shouting and screaming, and once came a sound like blows and sharp
cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks. Graham
strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven
tumult.

Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. For
a time he doubted his ears. But surely these were the words: \textquotedbl{}
how us the Sleeper! Show us the Sleeper!\textquotedbl{}

The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.

\textquotedbl{}Wild! \textquotedbl{} he cried, \textquotedbl{}How
do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing? \textquotedbl{}

There was perhaps an answer.

\textquotedbl{}I can't come,\textquotedbl{} said the thickset man;
\textquotedbl{}I have \emph{him} to see to. But shout from the balcony.\textquotedbl{}

There was an inaudible reply.

\textquotedbl{}Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you.\textquotedbl{}

He came hurrying back to Graham. \textquotedbl{}You must have clothes
at once,\textquotedbl{} he said. \textquotedbl{}You cannot stop here---and
it will be impossible to---\textquotedbl{}

He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him. In
a moment he was back.

\textquotedbl{}I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex
to explain. In a moment you shall have your clothes made. Yes---in
a moment. And then I can take you away from here. You will find out
our troubles soon enough.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}But those voices. They were shouting---?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Something about the Sleeper---that's you. They have
some twisted idea. I don't know what it is. I know nothing.\textquotedbl{}

A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote
noises, and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances
in the corner of the room. He listened for a moment, regarding a ball
of crystal, nodded, and said a few indistinct words; then he walked
to the wall through which the two men had vanished. It rolled up again
like a curtain, and he stood waiting.

Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the
restoratives had given him. He thrust one leg over the side of the
couch and then the other. His head no longer swam. He could scarcely
credit his rapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.

The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as
he did so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset
man, and a lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a
tightly-fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein.

\textquotedbl{}This is the tailor,\textquotedbl{} said the thickset
man with an introductory gesture.\textquotedbl{} It will never do
for you to wear that black. I cannot understand how it got here. But
I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid as possible? \textquotedbl{}
he said to the tailor.

The man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated himself by Graham on
the bed. His manner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity.
\textquotedbl{}You will find the fashions altered, Sire,\textquotedbl{}
he said. He glanced from under his brows at the thickset man. ,

He opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant
fabrics poured out over his knees. \textquotedbl{}You lived, Sire,
in a period essentially cylindrical---the Victorian. With a tendency
to the hemisphere in hats. Circular curves always. Now---\textquotedbl{}
He flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of a keyless
watch, whirled the knob, and behold---a little figure in white appeared
kinetoscope fashion on the dial, walking and turning. The tailor caught
up a pattern of bluish white satin. \textquotedbl{}That is my conception
of your immediate treatment,\textquotedbl{} he said.

The thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of Graham.

\textquotedbl{}We have very little time,\textquotedbl{} he said.

\textquotedbl{}Trust me,\textquotedbl{} said the tailor. \textquotedbl{}My
machine follows. What do you think of this? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}What is that?\textquotedbl{} asked the man from the
nineteenth century.

\textquotedbl{}In your days they showed you a fashion-plate,\textquotedbl{}
said the tailor,\textquotedbl{} but this is our modern development
See here.\textquotedbl{} The little figure repeated its evolutions,
but in a different costume. \textquotedbl{}Or this,\textquotedbl{}
and with a click another small figure in a more voluminous type of
robe marched on to the dial. The tailor was very quick in his movements,
and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these things.

It rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with features of the
Chinese type, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with
a complicated machine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors
into the room. Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, Graham
was invited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered
some instructions to the crop-haired lad, who answered in guttural
tones and with words Graham did not recognise. The boy then went to
conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the corner, and the tailor
pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in little discs, pulling
them out until the discs were flat against the body of Graham, one
at each shoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so
forth, so that at last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon
his body and limbs. At the same time, some other person entered the
room by the lift, behind Graham. The tailor set moving a mechanism
that initiated a faint-sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the
machine, and in another moment he was knocking up the levers and Graham
was released. The tailor replaced his cloak of black, and the man
with the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some refreshing
fluid. Graham saw over the rim of the glass a pale-faced young man
regarding him with a singular fixity.

The thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned
and went through the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise
of a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences. The cropheaded
lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began
fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of
paper in a nineteenth century printing machine. Then they ran the
entire thing on its easy, noiseless bearings across the room to a
remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from
the wall. They made some connexion and the machine became energetic
and swift.

\textquotedbl{}What is that doing?\textquotedbl{} asked Graham, pointing
with the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore the
scrutiny of the new comer. \textquotedbl{} Is that---some sort of
force---laid on? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes,\textquotedbl{} said the man with the flaxen beard.

\textquotedbl{}Who is that?\textquotedbl{} He indicated the archway
behind him.

The man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered
in an undertone, \textquotedbl{}He is Howard, your chief guardian.
You see, Sire,---it's a little difficult to explain. The Council appoints
a guardian and assistants. This hall has under certain restrictions
been public. In order that people might satisfy themselves. We have
barred the doorways for the first time. But I think---if you don't
mind, I will leave him to explain.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Odd\textquotedbl{} said Graham. \textquotedbl{} Guardian?
Council?\textquotedbl{} Then turning his back on the new comer, he
asked in an undertone, \textquotedbl{}Why is this man glaring at me?
Is he a mesmerist? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Capillotomist!\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes---one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz lions.\textquotedbl{}

It sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at the last phrase with
an unsteady mind. \textquotedbl{}Sixdoz lions?\textquotedbl{} he said.

\textquotedbl{}Didn't you have lions? I suppose not. You had the old
pounds? They are our monetary units.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}But what was that you said---sixdoz? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even these
little things, have altered. You lived in the days of the decimal
system, the Arab system---tens, and little hundreds and thousands.
We have eleven numerals now. We have single figures for both ten and
eleven, two figures for a dozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross,
a great hundred, you know, a dozen gross a dozand, and a dozand dozand
a myriad. Very simple?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I suppose so,\textquotedbl{} said Graham. \textquotedbl{}But
about this cap---what was it? \textquotedbl{}

The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.

\textquotedbl{}Here are your clothes!\textquotedbl{} he said. Graham
turned round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow smiling,
and holding some palpably new garments over his arm. The crop-headed
boy, by means of one finger, was impelling the complicated machine
towards the lift by which he had arrived. Graham stared at the completed
suit. \textquotedbl{}You don't mean to say---!\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Just made,\textquotedbl{} said the tailor. He dropped
the garments at the feet of Graham, walked to the bed on which Graham
had so recently been Iying, flung out the translucent mattress, and
turned up the looking glass. As he did so a furious bell summoned
the thickset man to the corner. The man with the flaxen beard rushed
across to him and then hurried out by the archway.

The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment,
stockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from
the corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the
balcony. They began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing
had an unmistakable quality of anxiety. Over the purple under-garment
came a I complex but graceful garment of bluish white, and I Graham
was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced,
unshaven and shaggy still, but at least naked no longer, and in some
indefinable unprecedented way graceful.

\textquotedbl{}I must shave,\textquotedbl{} he said regarding himself
in the glass.

\textquotedbl{}In a moment,\textquotedbl{} said Howard.

The persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his eyes, reopened
them, and with a lean hand extended, advanced on Graham. Then he stopped,
with his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about him.

\textquotedbl{}A seat,\textquotedbl{} said Howard impatiently, and
in a moment the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind Graham. \textquotedbl{}Sit
down, please,\textquotedbl{} said Howard.

Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wildeyed man he saw
the glint of steel.

\textquotedbl{}Don't you understand, Sire?\textquotedbl{} cried the
flaxen-bearded man with hurried politeness. \textquotedbl{}He is going
to cut your hair.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Oh!\textquotedbl{} cried Graham enlightened. \textquotedbl{}But
you called him--- \textquotedbl{}A capillotomist---precisely ! He
is one of the finest artists in the world.\textquotedbl{}

Graham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man disappeared. The
capillotomist came forward with graceful gestures, examined Graham's
ears and surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would have sat
down again to regard him but for Howard's audible impatience. Forthwith
with rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements
he shaved Graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and cut and arranged
his hair. All this he did without a word, with something of the rapt
air of a poet inspired. And as soon as he had finished Graham was
handed a pair of shoes.

Suddenly a loud voice shouted---it seemed from a piece of machinery
in the corner---\textquotedbl{}At once---at once. The people know
all over the city. Work is being stopped. Work is being stopped. Wait
for nothing, but come.\textquotedbl{}

This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. By his gestures
it seemed to Graham that he hesitated between two directions. Abruptly
he went towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the little
crystal ball. As he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from
the archway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to
a mighty sound, roared as if it were sweeping past, and fell again
as if receding swiftly. It drew Graham after it with an irresistible
attraction. He glanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse.
In two strides he was down the steps and in the passage, and, in a
score he was out upon the balcony upon which | the three men had been
standing.


\chapter{The Moving Ways}

He went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. An exclamation
of surprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number of people
came from the spacious area below.

His first impression was of overwhelming architecture. The place into
which he looked was an aisle of Titanic buildings, curving spaciously
in either direction. Overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across
the huge width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material
shut out the sky. Gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale
sunbeams that filtered down through the girders and wires. Here and
there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung
across the chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. A cliff
of edifice hung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and
the opposite facade was grey and dim and broken by great archings,
circular perforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections,
myriads of vast windows, and an intricate scheme of architectural
relief. Athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely
in an unfamiliar lettering. Here and there close to the roof cables
of a peculiar stoutness were fastened, and drooped in a steep curve
to circular openings on the opposite side of the space, and even as
Graham noted these a remote and tiny figure of a man clad in pale
blue arrested his attention. This little figure was far overhead across
the space beside the higher fastening of one of these festoons, hanging
forward from a little ledge of masonry and handling some well-nigh
invisible strings dependent from the line. Then suddenly, with a swoop
that sent Graham's heart into his mouth, this man had rushed down
the curve and vanished through a round opening on the hither side
of the way. Graham had been looking up as he came out upon the balcony,
and the things he saw above and opposed to him had at first seized
his attention to the exclusion of anything else. Then suddenly he
discovered the roadway! It was not a roadway at all, as Graham understood
such things, for in the nineteenth century the only roads and streets
were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling rivulets of vehicles
between narrow footways. But this roadway was three hundred feet across,
and it moved; it moved, all save the middle, the lowest part. For
a moment, the motion dazzled his mind. Then he understood.

Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to Graham's
right, an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century
express train, an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping
slats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures
of the street. Upon it were seats, and here and there little kiosks,
but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein.
From this nearest and swiftest platform a series of others descended
to the centre of the space. Each moved to the right, each perceptibly
slower than the one above it, but the difference in pace was small
enough to permit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent,
and so walk uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless middle
way. Beyond this middle way was another series of endless platforms
rushing with varying pace to Graham's left. And seated in crowds upon
the two widest and swiftest platforms, or stepping from one to another
down the steps, or swarming over the central space, was an innumerable
and wonderfully diversified multitude of people.

\textquotedbl{}You must not stop here,\textquotedbl{} shouted Howard
suddenly at his side. \textquotedbl{}You must come away at once.\textquotedbl{}

Graham made no answer. He heard without hearing. The platforms ran
with a roar and the people were shouting. He perceived women and girls
with flowing hair, beautifully robed, with bands crossing between
the breasts. These first came out of the confusion. Then he perceived
that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume was the pale
blue that the tailor's boy had worn. He became aware of cries of \textquotedbl{}The
Sleeper. What has happened to the Sleeper?\textquotedbl{} and it seemed
as though the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered
with the pale buff of human faces, and then still more thickly. He
saw pointing fingers. He perceived that the motionless central area
of this huge arcade just opposite to the balcony was densely crowded
with blue-clad people. Some sort of struggle had sprung into life.
People seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on either side,
and carried away against their will. They would spring off so soon
as they were beyond the thick of the confusion, and run back towards
the conflict.

\textquotedbl{}It is the Sleeper. Verily it is the Sleeper,\textquotedbl{}
shouted voices. \textquotedbl{}That is never the Sleeper,\textquotedbl{}
shouted others. More and more faces were turned to him. At the intervals
along this central area Graham noted openings, pits, apparently the
heads of staircases going down with people ascending out of them and
descending into them. The struggle it seemed centred about the one
of these nearest to him. People were running down the moving platforms
to this, leaping dexterously from platform to platform. The clustering
people on the higher platforms seemed to divide their interest between
this point and the balcony. A number of sturdy little figures clad
in a uniform of bright red, and working methodically together, were
employed it seemed in preventing access to this descending staircase.
About them a crowd was rapidly accumulating. Their brilliant colour
contrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their antagonists, for
the struggle was indisputable.

He saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear and shaking his
arm. And then suddenly Howard was gone and he stood alone.

He perceived that the cries of \textquotedbl{}The Sleeper\textquotedbl{}
grew in volume, and that the people on the nearer platform were standing
up. The nearer swifter platform he perceived was empty to the right
of him, and far across the space the platform running in the opposite
direction was coming crowded and passing away bare. With incredible
swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space before his
eyes; a dense swaying mass of people, and the shouts grew from a fitful
crying to a voluminous incessant clamour: \textquotedbl{}The Sleeper!\textquotedbl{}
The Sleeper!\textquotedbl{} and yells and cheers, a waving of garments
and cries of \textquotedbl{}Stop the ways!\textquotedbl{} They were
also crying another name strange to Graham. It sounded like \textquotedbl{}Ostrog.\textquotedbl{}
The slower platforms were soon thick with active people, running against
the movement so as to keep themselves opposite to him.

\textquotedbl{}Stop the ways,\textquotedbl{} they cried. Agile figures
ran up swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearest to him, were
borne rapidly past him, shouting strange, unintelligible things, and
ran back obliquely to the central way. One thing he distinguished:
\textquotedbl{}It is indeed the Sleeper. It is indeed the Sleeper,\textquotedbl{}
they testified.

For a space Graham stood without a movement. Then he became vividly
aware that all this concerned him. He was pleased at his wonderful
popularity, he bowed, and, seeking a gesture of longer range, waved
his arm. He was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked.
The tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence.
He became aware of crowded balconies, of men sliding along ropes,
of men in trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space. He heard voices
behind him, a number of people descending the steps through the archway;
he suddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was back again and
gripping his arm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear.

He turned, and Howard's face was white. \textquotedbl{}Come back,\textquotedbl{}
he heard. \textquotedbl{}They will stop the ways. The whole city will
be in confusion.\textquotedbl{}

He perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars
behind Howard, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard,
a tall man in vivid vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves,
and all these people had anxious eager faces.

\textquotedbl{}Get him away,\textquotedbl{} cried Howard.

\textquotedbl{}But why?\textquotedbl{} said Graham. \textquotedbl{}I
don't see---\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}You must come away!\textquotedbl{} said the man in
red in a resolute voice. His face and eyes were resolute, too. Graham's
glances went from face to face, and he was suddenly aware of that
most disagreeable flavour in life, compulsion. Some one gripped his
arm.... He was being dragged away. It seemed as though the tumult
suddenly became two, as if half the shouts that had come in from this
wonderful roadway had sprung into the passages of the great building
behind him. Marvelling and confused, feeling an impotent desire to
resist, Graham was half led, half thrust, along the passage of blue
pillars, and suddenly he found himself alone with Howard in a lift
and moving swiftly upward.


\chapter{The Hall of the Atlas}

From the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment
when Graham found himself in the lift, was altogether barely five
minutes. And as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about
him, as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this
remote age touched everything with wonder, with a sense of the irrational,
with something of the quality of a realistic dream. He was still detached,
an astonished spectator, still but half involved in life. What he
had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed in the setting
of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing witnessed from
the box of a theatre. \textquotedbl{}I don't understand,\textquotedbl{}
he said. \textquotedbl{}What was the trouble? My mind is in a whirl.
Why were they shouting? What is the danger?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}We have our troubles,\textquotedbl{} said Howard. His
eyes avoided Graham's enquiry. \textquotedbl{}This is a time of unrest.
And, in fact, your appearance, your waking just now, has a sort of
connexion---\textquotedbl{}

He spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. He stopped
abruptly.

\textquotedbl{}I don't understand,\textquotedbl{} said Graham.

\textquotedbl{}It will be clearer later,\textquotedbl{} said Howard.

He glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the
lift slow.

\textquotedbl{}I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen
my way about a little,\textquotedbl{} said Graham puzzled. \textquotedbl{}It.
will be---it is bound to be perplexing. At present it is all so strange.
Anything seems possible. Anything In the details even. Your counting,
I understand, is different.\textquotedbl{}

The lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long
passage between high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number
of tubes and big cables.

\textquotedbl{}What a huge place this is!\textquotedbl{} said Graham.
\textquotedbl{}Is it all one building? What place is it?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}This is one of the city ways for various public services.
Light and so forth.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Was it a social trouble---that---in the great roadway
place? How are you governed? Have you still a police?\textquotedbl{}
\textquotedbl{}Several,\textquotedbl{} said Howard.

\textquotedbl{}Several? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}About fourteen.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I don't understand.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Very probably not. Our social order will probably seem
very complex to you. To tell you the truth, I don't understand it
myself very clearly. Nobody does. You will, perhaps---bye and bye.
We have to go to the Council.\textquotedbl{} Graham's attention was
divided between the urgent necessity of his inquiries and the people
in the passages and halls they were traversing. For a moment his mind
would be concentrated upon Howard and the halting answers he made,
and then he would lose the thread in response to some vivid unexpected
impression. Along the passages, in the halls, half the people seemed
to be men in the red uniform. The pale blue canvas that had been so
abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear. Invariably these
men looked at him, and saluted him and Howard as they passed.

He had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were
a number of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class. He
saw no teacher, but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a
voice proceeded. The girls regarded him and his conductor, he thought,
with curiosity and astonishment. But he was hurried on before he could
form a clear idea of the gathering. He judged they knew Howard and
not himself, and that they wondered who he was. This Howard, it seemed,
was a person of importance. But then he was also merely Graham's guardian.
That was odd.

There came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway
hung so that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and
fro thereon, but no more of them. Then vague impressions of galleries
and of casual astonished passers-by turning round to stare after the
two of them with their red-clad guard.

The stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary.
He was speedily fatigued by this excessive haste. He asked Howard
to slacken his speed. Presently he was in a lift that had a window
upon the great street space, but this was glazed and did not open,
and they were too high for him to see the moving platforms below.
But he saw people going to and fro along cables and along strange,
frail-looking ridges.

And thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above
it. They crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass,
so clear that it made him giddy even to remember it. The floor of
it also was of glass. From his memory of the cliffs between New Quay
and Boscastle, so remote in time, and so recent in his experience,
it seemed to him that they must be near four hundred feet above the
moving ways. He stopped, looked down between his legs upon the swarming
blue and red multitudes, minute and fore- shortened, struggling and
gesticulating still towards the little balcony far below, a little
toy balcony, it seemed, where he had so recently been standing. A
thin haze and the glare of the mighty globes of light obscured everything.
A man seated in a little open- work cradle shot by from some point
still higher than the little narrow bridge, rushing down a cable as
swiftly almost as if he were falling. Graham stopped involuntarily
to watch this strange passenger vanish in a great circular opening
below, and then his eyes went back to the tumultuous struggle.

Along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots. This
broke up into individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring
down the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central
area. These men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons;
they seemed to be striking and thrusting. A great shouting, cries
of wrath, screaming, burst out and came up to Graham, faint and thin.
\textquotedbl{}Go on,\textquotedbl{} cried Howard, laying hands on
him.

Another man rushed down a cable. Graham suddenly glanced up to see
whence he came, and beheld through the glassy roof and the network
of cables and girders, dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans
of windmills, and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky.
Then Howard had thrust him forward across the bridge, and he was in
a little narrow passage decorated with geometrical patterns.

\textquotedbl{}I want to see more of that,\textquotedbl{} cried Graham,
resisting.

\textquotedbl{}No, no,\textquotedbl{} cried Howard, still gripping
his arm.

\textquotedbl{}This way. You must go this way.\textquotedbl{} And
the men in red following them seemed ready to enforce his orders.

Some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared
down the passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that
had seemed a door to Graham, and led the way through it. Graham found
himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber. The attendant
in black and yellow crossed this, thrust up a second shutter and stood
waiting.

This place had the appearance of an ante-room. He saw a number of
people in the central space, and at the opposite end a large and imposing
doorway at the top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained but giving
a glimpse of some still larger hall beyond. He perceived white men
in red and other negroes in black and yellow standing stiffly about
those portals.

As they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, \textquotedbl{}The
Sleeper,\textquotedbl{} and was aware of a turning of heads, a hum
of observation. They entered another little passage in the wall of
this ante-chamber, and then he found himself on an iron-railed gallery
of metal that passed round the side of the great hall he had already
seen through the curtains. He entered the place at the corner, so
that he received the fullest impression of its huge proportions. The
black in the wasp uniform stood aside like a well-trained servant,
and closed the valve behind him.

Compared with any of the places Graham had see thus far, this second
hall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness. On a pedestal
at the remote end, and more brilliantly lit than any other object,
was a gigantic white figure of Atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe
upon his bowed shoulders. It was the first thing to strike his attention,
it was so vast, so patiently and painfully real, so white and simple.
Save for this figure and for a dais in the centre, the wide floor
of the place was a shining vacancy. The dais was remote in the greatness
of the area; it would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not
been for the group of seven men who stood about a table on it, and
gave an inkling of its proportions. They were all dressed in white
robes, they seemed to have arisen that moment from their seats, and
they were regarding Graham steadfastly. At the end of the table he
perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances.

Howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this
mighty labouring figure. Then he stopped. The two men in red who had
followed them into the gallery came and stood on either hand of Graham.

\textquotedbl{}You must remain here,\textquotedbl{} murmured Howard,
\textquotedbl{}for a few moments,\textquotedbl{} and, without waiting
for a reply, hurried away along the gallery.

\textquotedbl{}But, \emph{why?\textquotedbl{}} began Graham.

He moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path obstructed by
one of the men in red. \textquotedbl{}You have to wait here, Sire,\textquotedbl{}
said the man in red.

\emph{\textquotedbl{}Why?\textquotedbl{}}

\textquotedbl{}Orders, Sire.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Whose orders? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Our orders, Sire.\textquotedbl{}

Graham looked his exasperation.

\textquotedbl{}What place is this?\textquotedbl{} he said presently.
\textquotedbl{}Who are those men? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}They are the lords of the Council, Sire.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}What Council? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}\emph{The} Council.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Oh!\textquotedbl{} said Graham, and after an equally
ineffectual attempt at the other man, went to the railing and stared
at the distant men in white, who stood watching him and whispering
together.

The Council? He perceived there were now eight, though how the newcomer
had arrived he had not observed. They made no gestures of greeting;
they stood regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men
might have stood in the street regarding a distant balloon that had
suddenly floated into view. What council could it be that gathered
there, that little body of men beneath the significant white Atlas,
secluded from every eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness?
And why should he be brought to them, and be looked at strangely and
spoken of inaudibly? Howard appeared beneath, walking quickly across
the polished floor towards them. As he drew near he bowed and performed
certain peculiar movements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. Then
he ascended the steps of the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the
end of the table.

Graham watched that visible inaudible conversation. Occasionally,
one of the white-robed men would glance towards him. He strained his
ears in vain. The gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated.
He glanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants\dots
. When he looked again Howard was extending his hands and moving his
head like a man who protests. He was interrupted, it seemed, by one
of the white-robed men rapping the table.

The conversation lasted an interminable time to Graham's sense. His
eyes rose to the still giant at whose feet the Council sat. Thence
they wandered at last to the walls of the hall. It was decorated in
long painted panels of a quasi-Japanese type, many of them very beautiful.
These panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark
metal, which passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries,
and the great structural lines of the interior. The facile grace of
these panels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the
centre of the scheme. Graham's eyes came back to the Council, and
Howard was descending the steps. As he drew nearer his features could
be distinguished, and Graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out
his cheeks. His countenance was still disturbed when presently he
reappeared along the gallery.

\textquotedbl{}This way,\textquotedbl{} he said concisely, and they
went on in silence to a little door that opened at their approach.
The two men in red stopped on either side of this door. Howard and
Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing back, saw the white-robed Council
still standing in a close group and looking at him. Then the door
closed behind him with a heavy thud, and for the first time since
his awakening he was in silence. The floor, even, was noiseless to
his feet.

Howard opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguous
chambers furnished in white and green. \textquotedbl{}What Council
was that? \textquotedbl{} began Graham. \textquotedbl{}What were they
discussing? What have they to do with me?\textquotedbl{} Howard closed
the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something in an undertone.
He walked slanting ways across the room and turned, blowing out his
cheeks again. \textquotedbl{}Ugh!\textquotedbl{} he grunted, a man
relieved.

Graham stood regarding him.

\textquotedbl{}You must understand,\textquotedbl{} began Howard abruptly,
avoiding Graham's eyes, \textquotedbl{}that our social order is very
complex. A half explanation, a bare unqualified statement would give
you false impressions. As a matter of fact---it is a case of compound
interest partly---your small fortune, and the fortune of your cousin
Warming which was left to you---and certain other beginnings---have
become very considerable. And in other ways that will be hard for
you to understand, you have become a person of significance---of very
considerable significance---involved in the world's affairs.\textquotedbl{}

He stopped.

\textquotedbl{}Yes?\textquotedbl{} said Graham.

\textquotedbl{}We have grave social troubles.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Yes? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, is advisable
to seclude you here.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Keep me prisoner! \textquotedbl{} exclaimed Graham.

\textquotedbl{}Well---to ask you to keep in seclusion.\textquotedbl{}

Graham turned on him. \textquotedbl{}This is strange!\textquotedbl{}
he said.

\textquotedbl{}No harm will be done you.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}No harm ! \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}But you must be kept here---\textquotedbl{} \textquotedbl{}While
I learn my position, I presume.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Precisely.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Very well then. Begin. Why \emph{harm?}\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{} Not now.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Why not? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It is too long a story, Sire.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}All the more reason I should begin at once. You say
I am a person of importance. What was that shouting I heard? Why is
a great multitude shouting and excited because my trance is over,
and who are the men in white in that huge council chamber? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}All in good time, Sire,\textquotedbl{} said Howard.
\textquotedbl{}But not crudely, not crudely. This is one of those
flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your awakening. No one
expected your awakening. The Council is consulting.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}What council? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}The Council you saw.\textquotedbl{}

Graham made a petulant movement. \textquotedbl{} This is not right,\textquotedbl{}
he said. \textquotedbl{} I should be told what is happening.

\textquotedbl{}You must wait. Really you must wait.\textquotedbl{}

Graham sat down abruptly. \textquotedbl{}I suppose since I have waited
so long to resume life,\textquotedbl{} he said, \textquotedbl{}that
I must wait a little longer.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That is better,\textquotedbl{} said Howard. \textquotedbl{}Yes,
that is much better. And I must leave you alone. For a space. While
I attend the discussion in the Council. I am sorry.\textquotedbl{}

He went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished.

Graham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in
some way he never came to understand, turned about, paced the room
restlessly, made the circuit of the room, and sat down. He remained
sitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow, biting his
finger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions
of this first hour of awakened life; the vast mechanical spaces, the
endless series of chambers and passages, the great struggle that roared
and splashed through these strange ways, the little group of remote
unsympathetic men beneath the colossal Atlas, Howard's mysterious
behaviour. There was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in
his mind---a vast inheritance perhaps misapplied---of some unprecedented
importance and opportunity. What had he to do? And this room's secluded
silence was eloquent of imprisonment!

It came into Graham's mind with irresistible conviction that this
series of magnificent impressions was a dream. He tried to shut his
eyes and succeeded, but that time-honoured device led to no awakening.

Presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments
of the two small rooms in which he found himself.

In a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished.
He was clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with
a little greyshot beard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness
streaked now with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in an
unfamiliar but graceful manner. He seemed a man of five-and-forty
perhaps. For a moment he did not perceive this was himself.

A flash of laughter came with the recognition. \textquotedbl{}To call
on old Warming like this!\textquotedbl{} he exclaimed, \textquotedbl{}and
make him take me out to lunch! \textquotedbl{}

Then he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few familiar
acquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his amusement
realised that every soul with whom he might jest had died many score
of years ago. The thought smote him abruptly and keenly; he stopped
short, the expression of his face changed to a white consternation.

The tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade
of that wonderful street reasserted itself. The shouting multitudes
came back clear and vivid, and those remote, inaudible, unfriendly
councilors in white. He felt himself a little figure, very small and
ineffectual, pitifully conspicuous. And all about him, the world was---strange.


\chapter{In the Silent Rooms}

Presently Graham resumed his examination of his apartments. Curiosity
kept him moving in spite of his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived,
was high, and its ceiling dome shaped', with an oblong aperture in
the centre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad vans seemed
to be rotating, apparently driving the air up the shaft. The faint
humming note of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet
place. As these vans sprang up one after the other, Graham could get
transient glimpses of the sky. He was surprised to see a star.

This drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these
rooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the
cornices. There were no windows. And he began to recall that along
all the vast chambers and passages he had traversed with Howard he
had observed no windows at all. Had there been windows? There were
windows on the street indeed, but were they for light? Or was the
whole city lit day and night for evermore, so that there was no night
there?

And another thing dawned upon him. There was no fireplace in either
room. Was the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments,
or was the whole City uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested
in these questions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls,
the simply constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the
labour of bedroom service was practically abolished. And over everything
was a curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form
and colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. There were several
very comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carrying
several bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear
substance like jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers,
no writing materials. \textquotedbl{}The world has changed indeed,\textquotedbl{}
he said.

He observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of
peculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white
that harmonized With the decorative scheme of the room, and in the
centre of this side projected a little apparatus about a yard square
and having a white smooth face to the room. A chair faced this. He
had a transitory idea that these cylinders might be books, or a modern
substitute for books, but at first it did not seem so.

The lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first sight it seemed
like Russian. Then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated English about
certain of the words. \textquotedbl{}oi Man huwdbi Kin\textquotedbl{}

forced itself on him as \textquotedbl{}The Man who would be King.\textquotedbl{}
\textquotedbl{}Phonetic spelling,\textquotedbl{} he said. He remembered
reading a story with that title, then he recalled the story vividly,
one of the best stories in the world. But this thing before him was
not a book as he understood it. He puzzled out the titles of two adjacent
cylinders. 'The Heart of Darkness,' he had never heard of before nor
'The Madonna of the Future'---no doubt if they were indeed stories,
they were by post Victorian authors.

He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced
it. Then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that. He opened
a sort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within, and on
the upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell. He
pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased. He became aware
of voices and music, and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front
face. He suddenly realised what this might be, and stepped back to
regard it.

On the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured,
and in this picture were figures that moved. Not only did they move,
but they were conversing in clear small voices. It was exactly like
reality viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through a
long tube. His interest was seized at once by the situation, which
presented a man pacing up and down and vociferating angry things to
a pretty but petulant woman. Both were in the picturesque costume
that seemed so strange to Graham. \textquotedbl{}I have worked,\textquotedbl{}
said the man, \textquotedbl{}but what have you been doing?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Ah!\textquotedbl{} said Graham. He forgot everything
else, and sat down in the chair. Within five minutes he heard himself
named, heard \textquotedbl{}when the Sleeper wakes,\textquotedbl{}
used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed himself
by, a thing remote and incredible. But in a little while he knew those
two people like l . intimate friends.

At last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of
the apparatus was blank again.

It was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see, unscrupulous,
pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire economic
struggle; there were allusions he did not understand, incidents that
conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of dubious
enlightenment. The blue canvas that bulked so largely in his first
impression of the city ways appeared again and again as the costume
of the common people. He had no doubt the story was contemporary,
and its intense realism was undeniable. And the end had been a tragedy
that oppressed him. He sat staring at the blankness.

He started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so absorbed in the latter-day
substitute for a novel, that he awoke to the little green and white
room with more than a touch of the surprise of his first awakening.

He stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland. The clearness
of the kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the vast place
of streets, the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking
hour, came back. These people had spoken of the Council with suggestions
of a vague universality of power. And they had spoken of the Sleeper;
it had not really struck him vividly at the time that he was the Sleeper.
He had to recall precisely what they had said.

He walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals
of the revolving fan. As the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the
noise of machinery came in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence.
Though the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he perceived
the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep blue---black almost,
with a dust of little stars.

He resumed his examination of the rooms. He could find no way of opening
the padded door, no bell nor other means of calling for attendance.
His feeling of wonder was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious
for information. He wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new
things. He tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to
him. Presently he became restless and eager for information, for distraction,
for fresh sensations.

He went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled
out the method of replacing the cylinders by others. As he did so,
it came into his mind that it must be these little appliances had
fixed the language so that it was still clear and understand- able
after two hundred years. The haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed
a musical fantasia. At first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous.
He presently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version
of the story of Tannhauser. The music was unfamiliar. But the rendering
was realistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did
not go to a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What was a Pleasure
City? A dream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer.

He became interested, curious. The story developed with a flavour
of strangely twisted sentimentality. Suddenly he did not like it.
He liked it less as it proceeded.

He had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pictures, no idealisations,
but photographed realities. He wanted no more of the twenty-second
century Venusberg. He forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth
century art, and gave way to an archaic indignation. He rose, angry
and half ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even in solitude.
He pulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought for
a means of stopping its action. Something snapped. A violet spark
stung and convulsed his arm and the thing was still. When he attempted
next day to replace these Tannhauser cylinders by another pair, he
found the apparatus broken....

He struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro, struggling
with intolerable vast impressions. The things he had derived from
the cylinders and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him.
It seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty
years of life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming
times. \textquotedbl{}We were making the future,\textquotedbl{} he
said, \textquotedbl{}and hardly any of us troubled to think what future
we were making. And here it is!\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}What have they got to, what has been done? How do I
come into the midst of it all?\textquotedbl{} The vastness of street
and house he was prepared for, the multitudes of people. But conflicts
in the city ways! And the systematised sensuality of a class of rich
men!

He thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic Utopia had so
oddly anticipated this actual experience. But here was no Utopia,
no Socialistic state. He had already seen enough to realise that the
ancient antithesis of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand
and abject poverty on the other, still prevailed. He knew enough of
the essential factors of life to understand that correlation. And
not only were the buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in
the street gigantic, but the voices he had heard in the ways, the
uneasiness of Howard, the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent.
What country was he in? Still England it seemed, and yet strangely
\textquotedbl{}un-English.\textquotedbl{} His mind glanced at the
rest of the world, and saw only an enigmatical veil.

He prowled about his apartment, examining everything as a caged animal
might do. He felt very tired, felt that feverish exhaustion that does
not admit of rest. He listened for long spaces under the ventilator
to catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding
in the city.

He began to talk to himself. \textquotedbl{}Two hundred and three
years! \textquotedbl{} he said to himself over and over again, laughing
stupidly. \textquotedbl{}Then I am two hundred and thirty-three years
old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely they haven't reversed the tendency
of our time and gone back to the rule of the oldest. My claims are
indisputable. Mumble, mumble. I remember the Bulgarian atrocities
as though it was yesterday. 'Tis a great age! Ha ha!\textquotedbl{}
He was surprised at first to hear himself laughing, and then laughed
again deliberately and louder. Then he realised that he was behaving
foolishly. \textquotedbl{}Steady,\textquotedbl{} he said. \textquotedbl{}Steady!\textquotedbl{}

His pacing became more regular. \textquotedbl{}This new world,\textquotedbl{}
he said. \textquotedbl{}I don't understand it. \emph{Why?} \dots
But it is all \emph{why!}\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things Let
me try and remember just how it began.\textquotedbl{}

He was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first
thirty years had become. He remembered fragments, for the most part
trivial moments, things of no great importance that he had observed.
His boyhood seemed the most accessible at first, he recalled school
books and certain lessons in mensuration. Then he revived the more
salient features of his life, memories of the wife long since dead,
her magic influence now gone beyond corruption, of his rivals and
friends and betrayers, of the swift decision of this issue and that,
and then of his , last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves, and
at last of his strenuous studies. In a little while he perceived he
had it all again; dim perhaps, like metal long laid aside, but in
no way defective or injured, capable of re-polishing. And the hue
of it was a deepening misery. Was it worth re-polishing? By a miracle
he had been lifted out of a life that had become intolerable.

He reverted to his present condition. He wrestled with the facts in
vain. It became an inextricable tangle. He saw the sky through the
ventilator pink with dawn. An old persuasion came out of the dark
recesses of his memory. \textquotedbl{}I must sleep,\textquotedbl{}
he said. It appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distress
and from the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs. He went to the
strange little bed, lay down and was presently asleep.

He was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments
before he left them, for he remained imprisoned for three days. During
that time no one, except Howard, entered his prison. The marvel of
his fate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel of his
survival. He had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched
away into this unaccountable solitude. Howard came regularly with
subtly sustaining and nutritive fluids, and light and pleasant foods,
quite strange to Graham. He always closed the door carefully as he
entered. On matters of detail he was increasingly obliging, but the
bearing of Graham on the great issues that were evidently being contested
so closely beyond the soundproof walls that enclosed him, he would
not elucidate. He evaded, as politely as possible, every question
on the position of affairs in the outer world.

And in those three days Graham's incessant thoughts went far and wide.
All that he had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him
seeing, worked together in his mind. Almost every possible interpretation
of his position he debated---even as it chanced, the right interpretation.
Things that presently happened to him, came to him at last credible,
by virtue of this seclusion. When at length the moment of his release
arrived, it found him prepared.

Howard's bearing went far to deepen Graham's impression of his own
strange importance; the door between its opening and closing seemed
to admit with him a breath of momentous happening. His enquiries became
more definite and searching. Howard retreated through protests and
difficulties. The awakening was unforeseen, he repeated; it happened
to have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion.

\textquotedbl{}To explain it I must tell you the history of a gross
and a half of years,\textquotedbl{} protested Howard.

\textquotedbl{}The thing is this,\textquotedbl{} said Graham. \textquotedbl{}You
are afraid of something I shall do. In some way I am arbitrator---I
might be arbitrator.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{} It is not that. But you have---I may tell you this
much---the automatic increase of your property puts great possibilities
of interference in your hands. And in certain other ways you have
influence, with your eighteenth century notions.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Nineteenth century,\textquotedbl{} corrected Graham.

\textquotedbl{}With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as you
are of every feature of our State.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Am I a fool? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Certainly not.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}You were never expected to act at all. No one counted
on your awakening. No one dreamt you would ever awake. The Council
had surrounded you with antiseptic conditions. As a matter of fact,
we thought that you were dead---a mere arrest of decay. And---but
it is too complex. We dare not suddenly---while you are still half
awake.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}It won't do,\textquotedbl{} said Graham. \textquotedbl{}Suppose
it is as you say---why am I not being crammed night and day with facts
and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit me for my responsibilities?
Am I any wiser now than two days ago, if it is two days, when I awoke?\textquotedbl{}

Howard pulled his lip.

\textquotedbl{}I am beginning to feel---every hour I feel more clearly---a
sense of complex concealment of which you are the salient point. Is
this Council, or committee, or whatever they are, cooking the accounts
of my estate? Is that it? \textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That note of suspicion---\textquotedbl{} said Howard.

\textquotedbl{} Ugh!\textquotedbl{} said Graham. \textquotedbl{}Now,
mark my words, it will be ill for those who have put me here. It will
be ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I am alive. Every day my
pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more vigorous. No more quiescence.
I am a man come back to life. And I want to \emph{live---}\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}\emph{Live!}\textquotedbl{}

Howard's face lit with an idea. He came towards Graham and spoke in
an easy confidential tone.

\textquotedbl{}The Council secludes you here for your good. You are
restless. Naturally---an energetic man! You find it dull here. But
we are anxious that everything you may desire---every desire---every
sort of desire\dots There may be something. Is there any sort of
company? \textquotedbl{}

He paused meaningly. \textquotedbl{} Yes,\textquotedbl{} said Graham
thoughtfully. \textquotedbl{} There is.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}Ah! \emph{Now!} We have treated you neglectfully.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}The crowds in yonder streets of yours.\textquotedbl{}

\textquotedbl{}That,\textquotedbl{} said Howard, \textquotedbl{}I
am afraid---. But---\textquotedbl{}

Graham began pacing the room. Howard stood near the door watching
him. The implication of Howard's suggestion was only half evident
to Graham Company? Suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand
some sort of \emph{company}? Would there be any possibilities of gathering
from the conversation o
